You are supposed to summarize the key information from the given context to answer the provided question.

Here is the given context:
"Telephone counseling and tailored print communications have emerged as promising methods for promoting mammography screening. However, there has been little research testing, within the same randomized field trial, of the efficacy of these two methods compared to a high-quality usual care system for enhancing screening. This study addressed the question: Compared to usual care, is tailored telephone counseling more effective than tailored print materials for promoting mammography screening? Three-year randomized field trial. One thousand ninety-nine women aged 50 and older recruited from a health maintenance organization in North Carolina. Women were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: (1) usual care, (2) tailored print communications, and (3) tailored telephone counseling. Adherence to mammography screening based on self-reports obtained during 1995, 1996, and 1997. Compared to usual care alone, telephone counseling promoted a significantly higher proportion of women having mammograms on schedule (71% vs 61%) than did tailored print (67% vs 61%) but only after the first year of intervention (during 1996). Furthermore, compared to usual care, telephone counseling was more effective than tailored print materials at promoting being on schedule with screening during 1996 and 1997 among women who were off-schedule during the previous year."

Problem:
"Can tailored interventions increase mammography use among HMO women?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.
assistant
The study investigated whether tailored interventions could increase mammography use among women aged 50 and older from a health maintenance organization (HMO) in North Carolina. Specifically, it compared the effectiveness of tailored telephone counseling and tailored print communications against usual care. The key findings are:

1. **Tailored Telephone Counseling vs. Usual Care**: Women receiving tailored telephone counseling had a significantly higher adherence rate to mammography screening compared to those receiving usual care (71% vs. 61%).

2. **Tailored Print Materials vs. Usual Care**: Women receiving tailored print materials also showed increased adherence to mammography screening compared to those receiving usual care (67% vs. 61%), but this effect was less pronounced and only significant after the first year of the intervention.

3. **Comparison Between Tailored Interventions**: Tailored telephone counseling was more effective than tailored print materials at promoting timely mammography screening among women who were previously off-schedule. This difference was observed during both 1996 and 1997.

In summary, tailored interventions, particularly telephone counseling, can increase mammography use among HMO women, with telephone counseling showing a more pronounced and sustained effect compared to tailored print materials.

You are supposed to summarize the key information from the given context to answer the provided question.

Here is the given context:
"From March 2007 to January 2011, 88 DBE procedures were performed on 66 patients. Indications included evaluation anemia/gastrointestinal bleed, small bowel IBD and dilation of strictures. Video-capsule endoscopy (VCE) was used prior to DBE in 43 of the 66 patients prior to DBE evaluation. The mean age was 62 years. Thirty-two patients were female, 15 were African-American; 44 antegrade and 44 retrograde DBEs were performed. The mean time per antegrade DBE was 107.4±30.0 minutes with a distance of 318.4±152.9 cm reached past the pylorus. The mean time per lower DBE was 100.7±27.3 minutes with 168.9±109.1 cm meters past the ileocecal valve reached. Endoscopic therapy in the form of electrocautery to ablate bleeding sources was performed in 20 patients (30.3%), biopsy in 17 patients (25.8%) and dilation of Crohn's-related small bowel strictures in 4 (6.1%). 43 VCEs with pathology noted were performed prior to DBE, with findings endoscopically confirmed in 32 cases (74.4%). In 3 cases the DBE showed findings not noted on VCE."

Problem:
"Double balloon enteroscopy: is it efficacious and safe in a community setting?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

To answer the question of whether double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) is efficacious and safe in a community setting, the relevant information from the context can be summarized as follows:

**Efficacy:**

- DBE was used to evaluate anemia/gastrointestinal bleed, small bowel IBD, and dilation of strictures in 66 patients.
- Endoscopic therapy (electrocautery, biopsy, and stricture dilation) was performed in 41 patients (61.4% of the total).
- Pathology findings from video-capsule endoscopy (VCE) were confirmed in 74.4% of the cases.

**Safety:**

- The procedure was performed on 88 patients over a period of 4 years, indicating a manageable workload in a community setting.
- The mean time per antegrade DBE was 107.4 minutes, and the mean time per retrograde DBE was 100.7 minutes, suggesting a feasible procedure time.
- The distance reached past the pylorus (318.4 cm) and past the ileocecal valve (168.9 cm) indicates the ability to effectively access the small bowel.

Overall, the data suggests that DBE is a viable option for evaluating and treating small bowel disorders in a community setting, with a good balance between efficacy and safety.

Here is the given context:
"Although observational data support an inverse relationship between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and coronary heart disease (CHD), genetic HDL deficiency states often do not correlate with premature CHD. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) measurements were obtained in cases comprising 10 different mutations in LCAT, ABCA1 and APOA1 to further evaluate the relationship between low HDL resulting from genetic variation and early atherosclerosis. In a 1:2 case-control study of sex and age-related (+/-5 y) subjects (n=114), cIMT was nearly identical between cases (0.66+/-0.17 cm) and controls (0.65+/-0.18 cm) despite significantly lower HDL cholesterol (0.67 vs. 1.58 mmol/l) and apolipoprotein A-I levels (96.7 vs. 151.4 mg/dl) (P<0.05)"

The context provides information on a study that investigated whether mutations causing low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) promote increased carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), an indicator of early atherosclerosis. The study involved 114 participants who had 10 different mutations in genes associated with low HDL, including LCAT, ABCA1, and APOA1. Despite having significantly lower HDL cholesterol levels (0.67 mmol/L) and apolipoprotein A-I levels (96.7 mg/dL) compared to controls (1.58 mmol/L and 151.4 mg/dL respectively), the cIMT measurements were similar between cases (0.66 ± 0.17 cm) and controls (0.65 ± 0.18 cm). This suggests that mutations leading to low HDL-C do not necessarily promote increased carotid intima-media thickness in this context.

Here is the given context:
"We evaluated the usefulness of a short stay or 23-hour ward in a pediatric unit of a large teaching hospital, Westmead Hospital, and an academic Children's hospital, The New Children's Hospital, to determine if they are a useful addition to the emergency service. This is a descriptive comparison of prospectively collected data on all children admitted to the short stay ward at Westmead Hospital (WH) during 1994 and the short stay ward at the New Children's Hospital (NCH) during 1997-98. These hospitals service an identical demographic area with the latter (NCH) a tertiary referral center. The following outcome measures were used: length of stay, appropriateness of stay, rate of admission to an in-hospital bed, and rate of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge. Adverse events were reported and patient follow-up was attempted at 48 hours after discharge in all cases. The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% (Westmead Hospital) and 14.7% (New Children's Hospital) of admissions, with 56% medical in nature, 30% surgical, and the remainder procedural or psychological. Admission patterns were similar, with asthma, gastroenteritis, convulsion, pneumonia, and simple surgical conditions accounting for most short stay ward admissions. The short stay ward increased hospital efficiency with an average length of stay of 17.5 hours (Westmead Hospital) compared to 20.5 hours (New Children's Hospital). The users of the short stay ward were children of young age less than 2 years, with stay greater than 23 hours reported in only 1% of all admissions to the short stay ward. The rate of patient admission to an in-hospital bed was low, (4% [Westmead Hospital] compared to 6% [New Children's Hospital]), with the number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of short stay ward discharge less than 1%. There were no adverse events reported at either short stay ward, with parental satisfaction high. The short stay ward was developed through reallocation of resources from within the hospital to the short stay ward. This resulted in estimated savings of $1/2 million (Westmead Hospital) to $2.3 million (New Children's Hospital) to the hospital, due to more efficient bed usage."

Problem:
"A short stay or 23-hour ward in a general and academic children's hospital: are they effective?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.
assistant
The study evaluated the effectiveness of short stay or 23-hour wards in two pediatric units: one at Westmead Hospital and another at The New Children's Hospital. Both hospitals serve an identical demographic area, with The New Children's Hospital being a tertiary referral center. Key findings include:

1. **Admissions**: 
   - The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% of admissions at Westmead Hospital and 14.7% at The New Children's Hospital.
   - Medical admissions made up 56%, surgical admissions 30%, and the rest were procedural or psychological.
   
2. **Patient Demographics**:
   - Most admissions were of children under 2 years old.
   - Only 1% of admissions lasted longer than 23 hours.

3. **Length of Stay**:
   - Average length of stay was 17.5 hours at Westmead Hospital and 20.5 hours at The New Children's Hospital.

4. **Utilization**:
   - The rate of patients needing an in-hospital bed was low, at 4% for Westmead Hospital and 6% for The New Children's Hospital.
   - Less than 1% of patients had unscheduled visits within 72 hours post-discharge.

5. **Safety and Satisfaction**:
   - No adverse events were reported.
   - Parental satisfaction was high.

6. **Cost Efficiency**:
   - The short stay ward led to more efficient bed usage.
   - Estimated savings ranged from $0.5 million to $2.3 million per year for each hospital.

Overall, the short stay wards were found to be effective in improving hospital efficiency and patient outcomes while maintaining high levels of safety and satisfaction.

Here is the given context:
"We evaluated the usefulness of a short stay or 23-hour ward in a pediatric unit of a large teaching hospital, Westmead Hospital, and an academic Children's hospital, The New Children's Hospital, to determine if they are a useful addition to the emergency service. This is a descriptive comparison of prospectively collected data on all children admitted to the short stay ward at Westmead Hospital (WH) during 1994 and the short stay ward at the New Children's Hospital (NCH) during 1997-98. These hospitals service an identical demographic area with the latter (NCH) a tertiary referral center. The following outcome measures were used: length of stay, appropriateness of stay, rate of admission to an in-hospital bed, and rate of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge. Adverse events were reported and patient follow-up was attempted at 48 hours after discharge in all cases. The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% (Westmead Hospital) and 14.7% (New Children's Hospital) of admissions, with 56% medical in nature, 30% surgical, and the remainder procedural or psychological. Admission patterns were similar, with asthma, gastroenteritis, convulsion, pneumonia, and simple surgical conditions accounting for most short stay ward admissions. The short stay ward increased hospital efficiency with an average length of stay of 17.5 hours (Westmead Hospital) compared to 20.5 hours (New Children's Hospital). The users of the short stay ward were children of young age less than 2 years, with stay greater than 23 hours reported in only 1% of all admissions to the short stay ward. The rate of patient admission to an in-hospital bed was low, (4% [Westmead Hospital] compared to 6% [New Children's Hospital]), with the number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of short stay ward discharge less than 1%. There were no adverse events reported at either short stay ward, with parental satisfaction high. The short stay ward was developed through reallocation of resources from within the hospital to the short stay ward. This resulted in estimated savings of $1/2 million (Westmead Hospital) to $2.3 million (New Children's Hospital) to the hospital, due to more efficient bed usage."

The study evaluated the effectiveness of short stay or 23-hour wards in two pediatric units: one at Westmead Hospital and another at The New Children's Hospital. Both hospitals serve an identical demographic area, with The New Children's Hospital being a tertiary referral center. Key findings include:

1. **Admissions**: 
   - The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% of admissions at Westmead Hospital and 14.7% at The New Children's Hospital.
   - Medical admissions made up 56%, surgical admissions 30%, and the rest were procedural or psychological.
   
2. **Patient Demographics**:
   - Most admissions were of children under 2 years old.
   - Only 1% of admissions lasted longer than 23 hours.

3. **Length of Stay**:
   - Average length of stay was 17.5 hours at Westmead Hospital and 20.5 hours at The New Children's Hospital.

4. **Utilization**:
   - The rate of patients needing an in-hospital bed was low, at 4% for Westmead Hospital and 6% for The New Children's Hospital.
   - Less than 1% of patients had unscheduled visits within 72 hours post-discharge.

5. **Safety and Satisfaction**:
   - No adverse events were reported.
   - Parental satisfaction was high.

6. **Cost Efficiency**:
   - The short stay ward led to more efficient bed usage.
   - Estimated savings ranged from $0.5 million to $2.3 million per year for each hospital.

Overall, the short stay wards were found to be effective in improving hospital efficiency and patient outcomes while maintaining high levels of safety and satisfaction."

"The objective of the current study is to determine to what extent the reduction of Chile's traffic fatalities and injuries during 2000-2012 was related to the police traffic enforcement increment registered after the introduction of its 2005 traffic law reform. A unique dataset with assembled information from public institutions and analyses based on ordinary least square and robust random effects models was carried out. Dependent variables were traffic fatality and severe injury rates per population and vehicle fleet. Independent variables were: (1) presence of new national traffic law; (2) police officers per population; (3) number of traffic tickets per police officer; and (4) interaction effect of number of traffic tickets per police officer with traffic law reform. Oil prices, alcohol consumption, proportion of male population 15-24 years old, unemployment, road infrastructure investment, years' effects and regions' effects represented control variables. Empirical estimates from instrumental variables suggest that the enactment of the traffic law reform in interaction with number of traffic tickets per police officer is significantly associated with a decrease of 8% in traffic fatalities and 7% in severe injuries. Piecewise regression model results for the 2007-2012 period suggest that police traffic enforcement reduced traffic fatalities by 59% and severe injuries by 37%."

"Trauma patients who require therapeutic anticoagulation pose a difficult treatment problem. The purpose of this study was to determine: (1) the incidence of complications using therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients, and (2) if any patient factors are associated with these complications. An 18-month retrospective review was performed on trauma patients>or= 15 years old who received therapeutic anticoagulation using unfractionated heparin (UH) and/or fractionated heparin (FH). Forty different pre-treatment and treatment patient characteristics were recorded. Complications of anticoagulation were documented and defined as any unanticipated discontinuation of the anticoagulant for bleeding or other adverse events. One-hundred-fourteen trauma patients were initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation. The most common indication for anticoagulation was deep venous thrombosis (46%). Twenty-four patients (21%) had at least 1 anticoagulation complication. The most common complication was a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring blood transfusion (11 patients). Five patients died (4%), 3 of whom had significant hemorrhage attributed to anticoagulation. Bivariate followed by logistic regression analysis identified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 9.2, 95%CI = 1.5-54.7), UH use (OR = 3.8, 95%CI = 1.1-13.0), and lower initial platelet count (OR = 1.004, 95%CI = 1.000-1.008) as being associated with complications. Patients receiving UH vs. FH differed in several characteristics including laboratory values and anticoagulation indications."

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.
assistant
The study examines the safety of therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients, specifically focusing on the incidence of complications and identifying patient factors associated with these complications. Key findings include:

1. **Incidence of Complications**: Out of 114 trauma patients who received therapeutic anticoagulation, 24 (21%) experienced at least one complication. The most frequent complication was a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring blood transfusion (11 patients).

2. **Mortality**: Five patients (4%) died, with three deaths attributed to significant hemorrhage related to anticoagulation.

3. **Risk Factors Identified**:
   - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 9.2, 95% CI = 1.5-54.7)
   - Use of unfractionated heparin (OR = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.1-13.0)
   - Lower initial platelet count (OR = 1.004, 95% CI = 1.000-1.008)

4. **Differences Between Heparin Types**: Patients receiving unfractionated heparin (UH) versus fractionated heparin (FH) showed differences in characteristics such as laboratory values and anticoagulation indications.

Overall, while therapeutic anticoagulation can be necessary in trauma patients, it carries a risk of complications, particularly in those with certain comorbidities and when using unfractionated heparin.

"Recent years have seen a rapid proliferation of emergency ultrasound (EUS) programs in the United States. To date, there is no evidence supporting that EUS fellowships enhance residents' ultrasound (US) educational experiences. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of EUS fellowships on emergency medicine (EM) residents' US education. We conducted a cross-sectional study at 9 academic medical centers. A questionnaire on US education and bedside US use was pilot tested and given to EM residents. The primary outcomes included the number of US examinations performed, scope of bedside US applications, barriers to residents' US education, and US use in the emergency department. The secondary outcomes were factors that would impact residents' US education. The outcomes were compared between residency programs with and without EUS fellowships. A total of 244 EM residents participated in this study. Thirty percent (95% confidence interval, 24%-35%) reported they had performed more than 150 scans. Residents in programs with EUS fellowships reported performing more scans than those in programs without fellowships (P = .04). Significant differences were noted in most applications of bedside US between residency programs with and without fellowships (P<.05). There were also significant differences in the barriers to US education between residency programs with and without fellowships (P<.05)."

A further development of SLT, the in situ split technique, is derived from LRT, which itself marks the optimized outcome in terms of postoperative graft function and survival. The combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, thus raising the question whether living donor liver transplantation is still necessary. Outcomes and postoperative liver function of 43 primary LRT patients were compared with those of 49 primary SLT patients (14 ex situ, 35 in situ) with known graft weight performed between April 1996 and December 2000. Survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. After a median follow-up of 35 months, actual patient survival rates were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group. Actual graft survival rates were 76% and 81%, respectively. The incidence of primary nonfunction was 12% in the SLT group and 2.3% in the LRT group. Liver function parameters (prothrombin time, factor V, bilirubin clearance) and surgical complication rates did not differ significantly. In the SLT group, mean cold ischemic time was longer than in the LRT group. Serum values of alanine aminotransferase during the first postoperative week were significantly higher in the SLT group. In the LRT group, there were more grafts with signs of fatty degeneration than in the SLT group."

The context discusses the comparison between split-liver transplantation (SLT) and living-related liver transplantation (LRT) in terms of patient and graft survival rates, liver function, and complications. The key findings are:

- Both SLT and LRT have high patient survival rates, with 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group after a median follow-up of 35 months.
- Graft survival rates are also high, with 76% in the SLT group and 81% in the LRT group.
- The incidence of primary nonfunction is lower in the LRT group (2.3%) compared to the SLT group (12%).
- Liver function parameters, such as prothrombin time, factor V, and bilirubin clearance, do not differ significantly between the two groups.
- Surgical complication rates are similar between the two groups.
- However, the SLT group has a longer mean cold ischemic time compared to the LRT group.
- The SLT group has higher serum values of alanine aminotransferase during the first postoperative week.
- The LRT group has more grafts with signs of fatty degeneration compared to the SLT group.

Considering these findings, the results suggest that both SLT and LRT are effective in terms of patient and graft survival, and liver function. However, the incidence of primary nonfunction is higher in the SLT group, and the LRT group has more grafts with signs of fatty degeneration.

- Both SLT and LRT have high patient survival rates, with 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group after a median follow-up of 35 months.
- Graft survival rates are also high, with 76% in the SLT group and 81% in the LRT group.
- The incidence of primary nonfunction is lower in the LRT group (2.3%) compared to the SLT group (12%).
- Liver function parameters, such as prothrombin time, factor V, and bilirubin clearance, do not differ significantly between the two groups.
- Surgical complication rates are similar between the two groups.
- However, the SLT group has a longer mean cold ischemic time compared to the LRT group.
- The SLT group has higher serum values of alanine aminotransferase during the first postoperative week.
- The LRT group has more grafts with signs of fatty degeneration compared to the SLT group.

Considering these findings, the results suggest that both SLT and LRT are effective in terms of patient and graft survival, and liver function. However, the incidence of primary nonfunction is higher in the SLT group, and the LRT group has more grafts with signs of fatty degeneration."

Based on the provided information, while both SLT and LRT are effective, the lower incidence of primary nonfunction and fewer signs of fatty degeneration in the LRT group suggest that living-related liver transplantation may still have advantages, especially considering ethical and availability factors in the context of pediatric patients.

"Elevated resting heart rate (RHR) is a neglected marker in cardiovascular risk factor studies of sub-Saharan African populations. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of elevated RHR and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to investigate any associations between RHR and these risk factors in a rural population in Ghana. Cross-sectional analysis. A total of 574 adults aged between 18-65 years were randomly sampled from a population register. Data collected included those on sociodemographic variables and anthropometric, blood pressure (BP), and RHR measurements. Within-person variability in RHR was calculated using data from repeat measurements taken 2 weeks apart. Of study participants, 36% were male. Prevalence of casual high BP was 19%. In the population, 10% were current cigarette smokers and habitual alcohol use was high at 56%. As measured by body mass index, 2% were obese and 14% had abdominal obesity. RHR was elevated (>90 bpm) in 19%. Overall, 79% of study participants were found to have at least one CVD risk factor. RHR was significantly associated with age, waist circumference, and BP. Individuals with an elevated RHR had a higher risk (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.15-3.26%, p = 0.013) of casual high BP compared with participants with normal RHR independently of several established CVD risk factors. The regression dilution ratio of RHR was 0.75 (95% CI 0.62-0.89)."

Smoking practices were examined in families with a high respiratory risk infant (born at very low birth weight; ventilated>12 hr) in a Houston, Texas, NICU. Socioeconomic status, race, and mental health status were hypothesized to be related to SHSe and household smoking bans. Data were collected as part of The Baby's Breath Project, a hospital-based SHSe intervention trial targeting parents with a high-risk infant in the NICU who reported a smoker in the household (N = 99). Measures of sociodemographics, smoking, home and car smoking bans, and depression were collected. Overall, 26% of all families with a high-risk infant in the NICU reported a household smoker. Almost half of the families with a smoker reported an annual income of less than $25,000. 46.2% of families reported having a total smoking ban in place in both their homes and cars. Only 27.8% families earning less than $25,000 reported having a total smoking ban in place relative to almost 60% of families earning more (p<.01).

A population based cross-sectional study of 4200 randomly selected adults registered with a General Medical Practice in North West, England. The study examined the association of chronic oro-facial pain with a variety of self-reported mechanical factors: teeth grinding, facial trauma, missing teeth and the feeling that the teeth did not fit together properly. Information was also collected on demographic factors, psychological factors and the reporting of other frequently unexplained syndromes. An adjusted response rate of 72% was achieved. Only two mechanical factors: teeth grinding (odds ratio (OR) 2.0, 95% CI 1.3-3.0) and facial trauma (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.3-2.9) were independently associated with chronic oro-facial pain after adjusting for psychological factors.

"To investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions.STUDY DESIGN/ A total of 123 dysphonic individuals with benign vocal pathologies were recruited. They were given either genuine acupuncture (n = 40), sham acupuncture (n = 44), or no treatment (n = 39) for 6 weeks (two 30-minute sessions/wk). The genuine acupuncture group received needles puncturing nine voice-related acupoints for 30 minutes, two times a week for 6 weeks, whereas the sham acupuncture group received blunted needles stimulating the skin surface of the nine acupoints for the same frequency and duration. The no-treatment group did not receive any intervention but attended just the assessment sessions. One-hundred seventeen subjects completed the study (genuine acupuncture = 40; sham acupuncture = 43; and no treatment = 34), but only 84 of them had a complete set of vocal functions and quality of life measures (genuine acupuncture = 29; sham acupuncture = 33; and no-treatment = 22) and 42 of them with a complete set of endoscopic data (genuine acupuncture = 16; sham acupuncture = 15; and no treatment = 11). Significant improvement in vocal function, as indicated by the maximum fundamental frequency produced, and also perceived quality of life, were found in both the genuine and sham acupuncture groups, but not in the no-treatment group. Structural (morphological) improvements were, however, only noticed in the genuine acupuncture group, which demonstrated a significant reduction in the size of the vocal fold lesions."

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

To address the problem of whether acupuncture is efficacious for treating phonotraumatic vocal pathologies, the relevant information from the context is as follows:

- The study involved 123 dysphonic individuals with benign vocal pathologies, who were divided into three groups: genuine acupuncture, sham acupuncture, and no treatment.
- The genuine acupuncture group received actual needles at nine voice-related acupoints, while the sham acupuncture group received blunted needles that only stimulated the skin surface.
- Both the genuine and sham acupuncture groups showed significant improvement in vocal function (measured by maximum fundamental frequency produced) and perceived quality of life compared to the no-treatment group.
- However, the genuine acupuncture group showed structural (morphological) improvements, with a significant reduction in the size of the vocal fold lesions.
- The study suggests that acupuncture, both genuine and sham, may be effective in treating phonotraumatic vocal pathologies, but the genuine acupuncture group showed additional benefits in terms of structural improvements.

The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of the definitive surgery for the acute subarachnoid cases aged 80 or older. We reviewed 500 consecutive cases with acute aSAH with surgical indication for aneurysm repair. Inoperable cases such as dead-on-arrival and the cases with both pupils dilated were excluded. We compared the cases aged 80 or older that received clipping or coil embolization with the controls that the family selected conservative treatment. 69 cases were included in this study (ranged 80-98, male:female=9:60). 56 cases (81.2%) had an aneurysm in the anterior circulation. 23 cases received clipping, 20 cases coil embolization and 26 cases treated conservatively.

"Recent evaluations of IT innovations in primary care have highlighted variations between centres and practices in uptake and use. We evaluated whether structural characteristics of a general practice were associated with variations in use of a web-based clinical information system underpinning a Managed Clinical Network in diabetes, between the years 2001 and 2003. Using a computerised audit trail, we calculated the numbers of web-based operations that occurred in each practice, stratified by staff type and year, and adjusted for the numbers of registered diabetic patients. In regression analyses, we determined whether total use was associated with structural characteristics of the practice (total list size, training status, numbers of GPs (general practitioners), mean age of the GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population and whether staff had received advanced training in diabetes care). Initially there were a few practices which made very frequent use of the information system, with relatively high numbers of practices using the facility infrequently. However, overall use gradually became more evenly spread. This effect was particularly evident among nurse users. Frequent use by GPs was evident in only a small number of practices, with mean GP use decreasing over the three years. In linear regression analyses, none of the general practice variables were associated with online use, either overall or stratified by staff type, except for the numbers of diabetes-educated staff. This was consistently associated with increased use by nurses and GPs."

However, the degree of tumour uptake of (18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -glucose (FDG) uptake is sometimes influenced by diabetes mellitus (DM). Therefore, we conducted this prospective study to compare the diagnostic ability of FDG-PET in patients with cervical cancer complicated by DM and those without DM. Patients with untreated locally advanced primary or clinically curable recurrent cervical carcinoma were enrolled. Both FDG-PET and MRI/CT scans were performed within 2 weeks. Patients were categorised into the following groups: hyperglycaemic DM (fasting blood sugar>126 mg/dl), euglycaemic DM and non-DM. The lesions were confirmed histologically or by clinical follow-up. The receiver operating characteristic curve method, with calculation of the area under the curve (AUC), was used to evaluate the discriminative power. From February 2001 to January 2003, 219 patients (75 with primary and 144 with recurrent cervical cancer) were eligible for analysis. Sixteen had hyperglycaemic DM, 12 had euglycaemic DM and 191 were in the non-DM group. The diagnostic power of PET in the hyperglycaemic DM, euglycaemic DM and non-DM groups did not differ significantly with regard to the identification of either metastatic lesions (AUC, 0.967/0.947/0.925, P>0.05) or primary tumours/local recurrence (AUC, 0.950/0.938/0.979, P>0.05).

"Telephone counseling and tailored print communications have emerged as promising methods for promoting mammography screening. However, there has been little research testing, within the same randomized field trial, of the efficacy of these two methods compared to a high-quality usual care system for enhancing screening. This study addressed the question: Compared to usual care, is tailored telephone counseling more effective than tailored print materials for promoting mammography screening? Three-year randomized field trial. One thousand ninety-nine women aged 50 and older recruited from a health maintenance organization in North Carolina. Women were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: (1) usual care, (2) tailored print communications, and (3) tailored telephone counseling. Adherence to mammography screening based on self-reports obtained during 1995, 1996, and 1997. Compared to usual care alone, telephone counseling promoted a significantly higher proportion of women having mammograms on schedule (71% vs 61%) than did tailored print (67% vs 61%) but only after the first year of intervention (during 1996). Furthermore, compared to usual care, telephone counseling was more effective than tailored print materials at promoting being on schedule with screening during 1996 and 1997 among women who were off-schedule during the previous year."

The context provides evidence that tailored interventions can increase mammography use among women in an HMO setting. Specifically:

- A three-year randomized field trial was conducted involving 1,099 women aged 50 and older from a health maintenance organization in North Carolina.
- Women were assigned to one of three groups: usual care, tailored print communications, or tailored telephone counseling.
- Tailored telephone counseling was found to be more effective than tailored print materials in promoting timely mammography screening.
- After the first year of the intervention (1996), 71% of those receiving telephone counseling had mammograms on schedule, compared to 61% in the usual care group and 67% in the tailored print group.
- The study also showed that telephone counseling was more effective than tailored print materials at helping women who were previously off-schedule get back on schedule for mammography screening during 1996 and 1997.

Here is the given context:
"From March 2007 to January 2011, 88 DBE procedures were performed on 66 patients. Indications included evaluation anemia/gastrointestinal bleed, small bowel IBD and dilation of strictures. Video-capsule endoscopy (VCE) was used prior to DBE in 43 of the 66 patients prior to DBE evaluation. The mean age was 62 years. Thirty-two patients were female, 15 were African-American; 44 antegrade and 44 retrograde DBEs were performed. The mean time per antegrade DBE was 107.4±30.0 minutes with a distance of 318.4±152.9 cm reached past the pylorus. The mean time per lower DBE was 100.7±27.3 minutes with 168.9±109.1 cm meters past the ileocecal valve reached. Endoscopic therapy in the form of electrocautery to ablate bleeding sources was performed in 20 patients (30.3%), biopsy in 17 patients (25.8%) and dilation of Crohn's-related small bowel strictures in 4 (6.1%). 43 VCEs with pathology noted were performed prior to DBE, with findings endoscopically confirmed in 32 cases (74.4%). In 3 cases the DBE showed findings not noted on VCE."

"Double balloon enteroscopy: is it efficacious and safe in a community setting?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.
assistant
The context provides evidence that double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) is both efficacious and safe in a community setting, as demonstrated by the following key points:

- **Procedure Volume and Patient Demographics**: Over a four-year period from March 2007 to January 2011, 88 DBE procedures were conducted on 66 patients, with a mean age of 62 years, including 32 females and 15 African-Americans.

- **Indications for DBE**: The procedures were primarily indicated for evaluating anemia or gastrointestinal bleeding, assessing small bowel inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and dilating strictures.

- **Pre-procedure Imaging**: Video-capsule endoscopy (VCE) was utilized before DBE in 43 out of 66 patients, with pathologic findings confirmed endoscopically in 32 cases (74.4%).

- **Technical Success and Safety**: The study indicates that DBE was technically successful, with an average procedure time of 107.4±30.0 minutes for antegrade DBEs and 100.7±27.3 minutes for lower DBEs. The distances reached were substantial, with an average of 318.4±152.9 cm past the pylorus and 168.9±109.1 cm past the ileocecal valve.

- **Therapeutic Efficacy**: Endoscopic therapies such as electrocautery for bleeding sources, biopsies, and dilation of Crohn's-related strictures were successfully performed in 20 (30.3%), 17 (25.8%), and 4 (6.1%) patients, respectively.

Overall, these data suggest that DBE is a viable, effective, and relatively safe diagnostic and therapeutic tool in a community setting.

Here is the given context:
"From March 2007 to January 2011, 88 DBE procedures were performed on 66 patients. Indications included evaluation anemia/gastrointestinal bleed, small bowel IBD and dilation of strictures. Video-capsule endoscopy (VCE) was used prior to DBE in 43 of the 66 patients prior to DBE evaluation. The mean age was 62 years. Thirty-two patients were female, 15 were African-American; 44 antegrade and 44 retrograde DBEs were performed. The mean time per antegrade DBE was 107.4±30.0 minutes with a distance of 318.4±152.9 cm reached past the pylorus. The mean time per lower DBE was 100.7±27.3 minutes with 168.9±109.1 cm meters past the ileocecal valve reached. Endoscopic therapy in the form of electrocautery to ablate bleeding sources was performed in 20 patients (30.3%), biopsy in 17 patients (25.8%) and dilation of Crohn's-related small bowel strictures in 4 (6.1%). 43 VCEs with pathology noted were performed prior to DBE, with findings endoscopically confirmed in 32 cases (74.4%).

The context provides evidence that double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) is both efficacious and safe in a community setting, as demonstrated by the following key points:

- **Procedure Volume and Patient Demographics**: Over a four-year period from March 2007 to January 2011, 88 DBE procedures were conducted on 66 patients, with a mean age of 62 years, including 32 females and 15 African-Americans.

- **Indications for DBE**: The procedures were primarily indicated for evaluating anemia or gastrointestinal bleeding, assessing small bowel inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and dilating strictures.

- **Pre-procedure Imaging**: Video-capsule endoscopy (VCE) was utilized before DBE in 43 out of 66 patients, with pathologic findings confirmed endoscopically in 32 cases (74.4%).

- **Technical Success and Safety**: The study indicates that DBE was technically successful, with an average procedure time of 107.4±30.0 minutes for antegrade DBEs and 100.7±27.3 minutes for lower DBEs. The distances reached were substantial, with an average of 318.4±152.9 cm past the pylorus and 168.9±109.1 cm past the ileocecal valve.

- **Therapeutic Efficacy**: Endoscopic therapies such as electrocautery for bleeding sources, biopsies, and dilation of Crohn's-related strictures were successfully performed in 20 (30.3%), 17 (25.8%), and 4 (6.1%) patients, respectively.

- Endoscopic therapy in the form of electrocautery to ablate bleeding sources was performed in 20 patients (30.3%), biopsy in 17 patients (25.8%), and dilation of Crohn's-related small bowel strictures in 4 (6.1%).

**Safety:**

- The study involved 88 DBE procedures performed on 66 patients over a 4-year period.
- The mean time per antegrade DBE was 107.4±30.0 minutes, and the mean time per retrograde DBE was 100.7±27.3 minutes, indicating manageable procedure times.
- The mean distance reached past the pylorus was 318.4±152.9 cm, and past the ileocecal valve was 168.9±109.1 cm, suggesting that DBE can effectively reach the desired areas for diagnosis and treatment.

Overall, these results suggest that DBE is both efficacious (able to confirm pathology and perform endoscopic therapy) and safe (with manageable procedure times and distances reached) in a community setting."

"We evaluated the usefulness of a short stay or 23-hour ward in a pediatric unit of a large teaching hospital, Westmead Hospital, and an academic Children's hospital, The New Children's Hospital, to determine if they are a useful addition to the emergency service. This is a descriptive comparison of prospectively collected data on all children admitted to the short stay ward at Westmead Hospital (WH) during 1994 and the short stay ward at the New Children's Hospital (NCH) during 1997-98. These hospitals service an identical demographic area with the latter (NCH) a tertiary referral center. The following outcome measures were used: length of stay, appropriateness of stay, rate of admission to an in-hospital bed, and rate of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge. Adverse events were reported and patient follow-up was attempted at 48 hours after discharge in all cases. The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% (Westmead Hospital) and 14.7% (New Children's Hospital) of admissions, with 56% medical in nature, 30% surgical, and the remainder procedural or psychological. Admission patterns were similar, with asthma, gastroenteritis, convulsion, pneumonia, and simple surgical conditions accounting for most short stay ward admissions. The short stay ward increased hospital efficiency with an average length of stay of 17.5 hours (Westmead Hospital) compared to 20.5 hours (New Children's Hospital). The users of the short stay ward were children of young age less than 2 years, with stay greater than 23 hours reported in only 1% of all admissions to the short stay ward. The rate of patient admission to an in-hospital bed was low, (4% [Westmead Hospital] compared to 6% [New Children's Hospital]), with the number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of short stay ward discharge less than 1%. There were no adverse events reported at either short stay ward, with parental satisfaction high. The short stay ward was developed through reallocation of resources from within the hospital to the short stay ward. This resulted in estimated savings of $1/2 million (Westmead Hospital) to $2.3 million (New Children's Hospital) to the hospital, due to more efficient bed usage."

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

To answer the question, I will summarize the key information from the context:

The context discusses the effectiveness of short stay or 23-hour wards in two pediatric units: Westmead Hospital and New Children's Hospital. The key findings are:

1.  **Efficiency and Length of Stay**: The short stay ward increased hospital efficiency with an average length of stay of 17.5 hours (Westmead Hospital) and 20.5 hours (New Children's Hospital).
2.  **Admission Patterns**: The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% (Westmead Hospital) and 14.7% (New Children's Hospital) of admissions, with most admissions due to asthma, gastroenteritis, convulsions, pneumonia, and simple surgical conditions.
3.  **Age and Stay Duration**: Children under 2 years old used the short stay ward, with only 1% of admissions having a stay greater than 23 hours.
4.  **Admission to In-Hospital Bed**: The rate of patient admission to an in-hospital bed was low, at 4% (Westmead Hospital) and 6% (New Children's Hospital).
5.  **Unscheduled Visits**: The number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of short stay ward discharge was less than 1%.
6.  **Adverse Events and Satisfaction**: There were no adverse events reported, and parental satisfaction was high.
7.  **Financial Benefits**: The short stay ward resulted in estimated savings of $1.5 million (Westmead Hospital) to $2.3 million (New Children's Hospital) due to more efficient bed usage.

Based on these findings, the short stay or 23-hour wards in both hospitals appear to be effective in increasing hospital efficiency, reducing length of stay, and providing a safe and satisfactory experience for patients and their parents.

To address the problem, I'll summarize the key information from the context:

1.  The short stay ward at both Westmead Hospital and New Children's Hospital accounted for 10.3% and 14.7% of admissions, respectively.
2.  The short stay ward increased hospital efficiency by reducing the average length of stay to 17.5 hours (Westmead Hospital) and 20.5 hours (New Children's Hospital).
3.  The short stay ward was most commonly used by children under 2 years old, with only 1% of admissions staying longer than 23 hours.
4.  The rate of admission to an in-hospital bed was low, at 4% (Westmead Hospital) and 6% (New Children's Hospital).
5.  The number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge was less than 1%.
6.  There were no adverse events reported at either short stay ward, and parental satisfaction was high.
7.  The development of the short stay ward resulted in estimated savings of $1.5 million (Westmead Hospital) to $2.3 million (New Children's Hospital) due to more efficient bed usage.

Based on this information, the short stay or 23-hour ward appears to be an effective addition to the emergency service in both general and academic children's hospitals, as it reduces length of stay, increases efficiency, and saves hospital resources.

Problem:
"A short stay or 23-hour ward in a general and academic children's hospital: are they effective?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

To address the problem, I'll summarize the key information from the context:

1.  The short stay ward at both Westmead Hospital and New Children's Hospital accounted for 10.3% and 14.7% of admissions, respectively.
2.  The short stay ward increased hospital efficiency by reducing the average length of stay to 17.5 hours (Westmead Hospital) and 20.5 hours (New Children's Hospital).
3.  The short stay ward was most commonly used by children under 2 years old, with only 1% of admissions staying longer than 23 hours.
4.  The rate of admission to an in-hospital bed was low, at 4% (Westmead Hospital) and 6% (New Children's Hospital).
5.  The number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge was less than 1%.
6.  There were no adverse events reported at either short stay ward, and parental satisfaction was high.
7.  The development of the short stay ward resulted in estimated savings of $1.5 million (Westmead Hospital) to $2.3 million (New Children's Hospital) due to more efficient bed usage.

Based on this information, the short stay or 23-hour ward appears to be an effective addition to the emergency service in both general and academic children's hospitals, as it reduces length of stay, increases efficiency, and saves hospital resources."

The study evaluated the effectiveness of short stay or 23-hour wards in two pediatric units: Westmead Hospital and The New Children's Hospital. Both hospitals serve a similar demographic area, with The New Children's Hospital being a tertiary referral center. Key findings include:

1. **Admissions**: 
   - The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% of admissions at Westmead Hospital and 14.7% at The New Children's Hospital.
   - Medical admissions made up 56%, surgical admissions 30%, and the rest were procedural or psychological.

2. **Admission Patterns**:
   - Common conditions leading to short stay ward admissions included asthma, gastroenteritis, convulsion, pneumonia, and simple surgical conditions.

3. **Length of Stay**:
   - Average length of stay was shorter at the short stay ward: 17.5 hours at Westmead Hospital and 20.5 hours at The New Children's Hospital.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The short stay ward improved hospital efficiency by reducing the average length of stay.
   - Estimated savings ranged from $0.5 million to $2.3 million per year due to more efficient bed usage.

5. **Adverse Events and Patient Satisfaction**:
   - No adverse events were reported.
   - Parental satisfaction was high.

Here is the given context:
"The objective of the current study is to determine to what extent the reduction of Chile's traffic fatalities and injuries during 2000-2012 was related to the police traffic enforcement increment registered after the introduction of its 2005 traffic law reform. A unique dataset with assembled information from public institutions and analyses based on ordinary least square and robust random effects models was carried out. Dependent variables were traffic fatality and severe injury rates per population and vehicle fleet. Independent variables were: (1) presence of new national traffic law; (2) police officers per population; (3) number of traffic tickets per police officer; and (4) interaction effect of number of traffic tickets per police officer with traffic law reform. Oil prices, alcohol consumption, proportion of male population 15-24 years old, unemployment, road infrastructure investment, years' effects and regions' effects represented control variables. Empirical estimates from instrumental variables suggest that the enactment of the traffic law reform in interaction with number of traffic tickets per police officer is significantly associated with a decrease of 8% in traffic fatalities and 7% in severe injuries. Piecewise regression model results for the 2007-2012 period suggest that police traffic enforcement reduced traffic fatalities by 59% and severe injuries by 37%."

The context indicates that Chile's traffic law reform, introduced in 2005, was associated with an increase in police traffic enforcement, which contributed to a significant reduction in traffic fatalities and severe injuries. Specifically, the empirical estimates suggest that the interaction between the traffic law reform and the number of traffic tickets per police officer led to an 8% decrease in traffic fatalities and a 7% decrease in severe injuries. Additionally, piecewise regression model results for the 2007-2012 period show that increased police traffic enforcement reduced traffic fatalities by 59% and severe injuries by 37%. This evidence supports the conclusion that Chile's traffic law reform did indeed push for increased police enforcement, resulting in notable improvements in traffic safety.

Specifically, the empirical estimates suggest that the interaction between the traffic law reform and the number of traffic tickets per police officer led to an 8% decrease in traffic fatalities and a 7% decrease in severe injuries. Additionally, piecewise regression model results for the 2007-2012 period show that increased police traffic enforcement reduced traffic fatalities by 59% and severe injuries by 37%. This evidence supports the conclusion that Chile's traffic law reform did indeed push for increased police enforcement, resulting in notable improvements in traffic safety."

Here is the given context:
"The objective of the current study is to determine to what extent the reduction of Chile's traffic fatalities and injuries during 2000-2012 was related to the police traffic enforcement increment registered after the introduction of its 2005 traffic law reform. A unique dataset with assembled information from public institutions and analyses based on ordinary least square and robust random effects models was carried out. Dependent variables were traffic fatality and severe injury rates per population and vehicle fleet. Independent variables were: (1) presence of new national traffic law; (2) police officers per population; (3) number of traffic tickets per police officer; and (4) interaction effect of number of traffic tickets per police officer with traffic law reform. Oil prices, alcohol consumption, proportion of male population 15-24 years old, unemployment, road infrastructure investment, years' effects and regions' effects represented control variables. Empirical estimates from instrumental variables suggest that the enactment of the traffic law reform in interaction with number of traffic tickets per police officer is significantly associated with a decrease of 8% in traffic fatalities and 7% in severe injuries.

You are supposed to summarize the key information from the given context to answer the provided question.

Here is the given context:
"Trauma patients who require therapeutic anticoagulation pose a difficult treatment problem. The purpose of this study was to determine: (1) the incidence of complications using therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients, and (2) if any patient factors are associated with these complications. An 18-month retrospective review was performed on trauma patients>or= 15 years old who received therapeutic anticoagulation using unfractionated heparin (UH) and/or fractionated heparin (FH). Forty different pre-treatment and treatment patient characteristics were recorded. Complications of anticoagulation were documented and defined as any unanticipated discontinuation of the anticoagulant for bleeding or other adverse events. One-hundred-fourteen trauma patients were initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation. The most common indication for anticoagulation was deep venous thrombosis (46%). Twenty-four patients (21%) had at least 1 anticoagulation complication. The most common complication was a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring blood transfusion (11 patients). Five patients died (4%), 3 of whom had significant hemorrhage attributed to anticoagulation. Bivariate followed by logistic regression analysis identified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 9.2, 95%CI = 1.5-54.7), UH use (OR = 3.8, 95%CI = 1.1-13.0), and lower initial platelet count (OR = 1.004, 95%CI = 1.000-1.008) as being associated with complications. Patients receiving UH vs. FH differed in several characteristics including laboratory values and anticoagulation indications."

Problem:
"Therapeutic anticoagulation in the trauma patient: is it safe?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

To address the problem "Therapeutic anticoagulation in the trauma patient: is it safe?", the relevant information from the context can be summarized as follows:

- Out of 114 trauma patients who received therapeutic anticoagulation, 24 (21%) experienced at least 1 anticoagulation complication.
- The most common complication was a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring blood transfusion (11 patients).
- Five patients died (4%), 3 of whom had significant hemorrhage attributed to anticoagulation.
- Bivariate and logistic regression analysis identified several factors associated with complications:
  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR = 9.2, 95%CI = 1.5-54.7)
  - Use of unfractionated heparin (UH) (OR = 3.8, 95%CI = 1.1-13.0)
  - Lower initial platelet count (OR = 1.004, 95%CI = 1.000-1.008)

This information suggests that therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients may not be entirely safe, as 21% of patients experienced complications, and 4% of patients died due to anticoagulation-related hemorrhage. However, the study also identified factors associated with an increased risk of complications, which could help guide treatment decisions.

Here is the given context:
"Trauma patients who require therapeutic anticoagulation pose a difficult treatment problem. The purpose of this study was to determine: (1) the incidence of complications using therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients, and (2) if any patient factors are associated with these complications. An 18-month retrospective review was performed on trauma patients>or= 15 years old who received therapeutic anticoagulation using unfractionated heparin (UH) and/or fractionated heparin (FH). Forty different pre-treatment and treatment patient characteristics were recorded. Complications of anticoagulation were documented and defined as any unanticipated discontinuation of the anticoagulant for bleeding or other adverse events. One-hundred-fourteen trauma patients were initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation. The most common indication for anticoagulation was deep venous thrombosis (46%). Twenty-four patients (21%) had at least 1 anticoagulation complication. The most common complication was a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring blood transfusion (11 patients). Five patients died (4%), 3 of whom had significant hemorrhage attributed to anticoagulation. Bivariate followed by logistic regression analysis identified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 9.2, 95%CI = 1.5-54.7), UH use (OR = 3.8, 95%CI = 1.1-13.0), and lower initial platelet count (OR = 1.004, 95%CI = 1.000-1.008) as being associated with complications. Patients receiving UH vs. FH differed in several characteristics including laboratory values and anticoagulation indications."

Problem:
"Therapeutic anticoagulation in the trauma patient: is it safe?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

The study aimed to investigate the safety of therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients. Key findings include:

- 114 trauma patients were initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation, with 24 (21%) experiencing at least 1 anticoagulation complication.
- The most common complication was a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring blood transfusion (11 patients).
- 5 patients (4%) died, with 3 deaths attributed to significant hemorrhage due to anticoagulation.
- Factors associated with complications were:
  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
  - Use of unfractionated heparin (UH) compared to fractionated heparin (FH)
  - Lower initial platelet count

These findings suggest that therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients is not entirely safe, with a significant incidence of complications, particularly bleeding events.

The study examines the safety of therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients. Here are the key points:

- **Incidence of Complications**: Out of 114 trauma patients who received anticoagulation, 24 (21%) experienced at least one complication.
- **Common Complications**: The most frequent complication was a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring a blood transfusion (11 patients).
- **Mortality**: Five patients (4%) died; three of these deaths were attributed to significant hemorrhage caused by anticoagulation.
- **Risk Factors Identified**: 
  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 9.2, 95% CI = 1.5-54.7)
  - Unfractionated heparin (UH) use (OR = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.1-13.0)
  - Lower initial platelet count (OR = 1.004, 95% CI = 1.000-1.008)

- **Comparison Between Heparins**: Patients receiving unfractionated heparin (UH) versus fractionated heparin (FH) showed differences in characteristics such as laboratory values and anticoagulation indications.

Overall, while therapeutic anticoagulation can be necessary, it carries risks, particularly in certain patient groups and when using unfractionated heparin.

Here is the given context:
"Electronic health records have the potential to facilitate family history use by primary care physicians (PCPs) to provide personalized care. The objective of this study was to determine whether automated, at-the-visit tailored prompts about family history risk change PCP behavior. Automated, tailored prompts highlighting familial risk for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and breast, colorectal, or ovarian cancer were implemented during 2011 to 2012. Medical records of a cohort of community-based primary care patients, aged 35 to 65 years, who previously participated in our Family Healthware study and had a moderate or strong familial risk for any of the 6 diseases were subsequently reviewed.

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

The study aimed to determine whether automated, tailored prompts about family history risk can change the behavior of primary care physicians (PCPs) in providing personalized care. The study found that:

- 695 out of 847 visits had a physician response to the family history prompts.
- 53.5% of visits resulted in the physician reviewing family history.
- 22.9% of visits led to a discussion of family history.
- 22.3% of visits did not address family history.
- Only 0.7% of visits resulted in reviewing family history and ordering tests/referrals.
- There was no significant change in the documentation of risk status or screening interventions for the 6 diseases studied (heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and breast, colorectal, or ovarian cancer) due to the prompts.

The study aimed to assess whether automated, at-the-visit tailored prompts about family history risk could change primary care provider (PCP) behavior. These prompts were implemented during 2011 to 2012 to highlight familial risk for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain cancers (breast, colorectal, or ovarian). The focus was on a cohort of community-based primary care patients aged 35 to 65 years with a moderate or strong familial risk for any of these six diseases. 

During the study period, 847 visits involving 492 eligible patients were analyzed. Of these visits:
- 53.5% involved the review of family history.
- 22.9% involved the discussion of family history.
- 22.3% did not address family history.
- 0.7% resulted in both the review of family history and the ordering of tests or referrals.

Despite the implementation of these prompts, there was no significant change in the documentation of risk status in problem summary lists or in the provision of screening interventions for any of the six diseases.

The focus was on a cohort of community-based primary care patients aged 35 to 65 years with a moderate or strong familial risk for any of these six diseases. 

During the study period, 847 visits involving 492 eligible patients were analyzed. Of these visits:
- 53.5% involved the review of family history.
- 22.9% involved the discussion of family history.
- 22.3% did not address family history.
- 0.7% resulted in both the review of family history and the ordering of tests or referrals.

Despite the implementation of these prompts, there was no significant change in the documentation of risk status in problem summary lists or in the provision of screening interventions for any of the six diseases."

Here is the given context:
"Recent years have seen a rapid proliferation of emergency ultrasound (EUS) programs in the United States. To date, there is no evidence supporting that EUS fellowships enhance residents' ultrasound (US) educational experiences. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of EUS fellowships on emergency medicine (EM) residents' US education. We conducted a cross-sectional study at 9 academic medical centers. A questionnaire on US education and bedside US use was pilot tested and given to EM residents. The primary outcomes included the number of US examinations performed, scope of bedside US applications, barriers to residents' US education, and US use in the emergency department. The secondary outcomes were factors that would impact residents' US education. The outcomes were compared between residency programs with and without EUS fellowships. A total of 244 EM residents participated in this study. Thirty percent (95% confidence interval, 24%-35%) reported they had performed more than 150 scans. Residents in programs with EUS fellowships reported performing more scans than those in programs without fellowships (P = .04). Significant differences were noted in most applications of bedside US between residency programs with and without fellowships (P<.05). There were also significant differences in the barriers to US education between residency programs with and without fellowships (P<.05)."

The context describes a study aimed at determining the impact of emergency ultrasound (EUS) fellowships on emergency medicine (EM) residents' ultrasound education. Key findings include:

- Among 244 EM residents surveyed across 9 academic medical centers, 30% reported having performed more than 150 scans.
- Residents in programs with EUS fellowships reported performing more ultrasound scans compared to those in programs without fellowships (P = .04).
- Significant differences were observed in the scope of bedside ultrasound applications between residency programs with and without EUS fellowships (P < .05).
- There were also notable differences in the barriers to ultrasound education between these two groups of residency programs (P < .05).

These results suggest that EUS fellowships may positively impact EM residents' ultrasound education by increasing the number of scans performed and the range of applications for bedside ultrasound.

A further development of SLT, the in situ split technique, is derived from LRT, which itself marks the optimized outcome in terms of postoperative graft function and survival. The combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, thus raising the question whether living donor liver transplantation is still necessary. Outcomes and postoperative liver function of 43 primary LRT patients were compared with those of 49 primary SLT patients (14 ex situ, 35 in situ) with known graft weight performed between April 1996 and December 2000. Survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. After a median follow-up of 35 months, actual patient survival rates were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group. Actual graft survival rates were 76% and 81%, respectively. The incidence of primary nonfunction was 12% in the SLT group and 2.3% in the LRT group. Liver function parameters (prothrombin time, factor V, bilirubin clearance) and surgical complication rates did not differ significantly. In the SLT group, mean cold ischemic time was longer than in the LRT group. Serum values of alanine aminotransferase during the first postoperative week were significantly higher in the SLT group. In the LRT group, there were more grafts with signs of fatty degeneration than in the SLT group."

Problem:
"Is there still a need for living-related liver transplantation in children?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

To answer the question "Is there still a need for living-related liver transplantation in children?", the relevant information from the context is as follows:

- The combination of split-liver transplantation (SLT) and living-related liver transplantation (LRT) has eliminated deaths on the waiting list.
- The actual patient survival rates after a median follow-up of 35 months were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group.
- The actual graft survival rates after a median follow-up of 35 months were 76% in the SLT group and 81% in the LRT group.
- The incidence of primary nonfunction was 12% in the SLT group and 2.3% in the LRT group.
- The incidence of surgical complications and liver function parameters did not differ significantly between the two groups.

This information suggests that split-liver transplantation has become a viable alternative to living-related liver transplantation, with comparable outcomes in terms of patient and graft survival, liver function, and surgical complications. This raises the question of whether living-related liver transplantation is still necessary.

Based on the provided data, while split-liver transplantation has comparable outcomes to living-related liver transplantation, the necessity of living-related liver transplantation in children can depend on specific clinical scenarios such as the size of the child and the availability of a suitable living donor. Therefore, it may still be considered necessary in certain cases.

To answer the question of whether there is still a need for living-related liver transplantation (LRT) in children, we can summarize the relevant information from the context as follows:

- The study compared the outcomes of 43 primary LRT patients with those of 49 primary split-liver transplantation (SLT) patients.
- The actual patient survival rates after a median follow-up of 35 months were 88% in the LRT group and 82% in the SLT group.
- The actual graft survival rates were 81% in the LRT group and 76% in the SLT group.
- The incidence of primary nonfunction was higher in the SLT group (12%) compared to the LRT group (2.3%).
- The study suggests that LRT has an optimized outcome in terms of postoperative graft function and survival compared to SLT.

Based on these findings, it can be inferred that living-related liver transplantation (LRT) still has a significant advantage over split-liver transplantation (SLT) in terms of patient and graft survival rates, and lower incidence of primary nonfunction. Therefore, there may still be a need for LRT in children.

The provided context does not specifically address living-related liver transplantation (LRT) in children. Instead, it compares split-liver transplantation (SLT) and LRT in adults. Key points from the context that relate to the broader question of the necessity of LRT include:

- Both SLT and LRT have been developed to optimize postoperative graft function and survival.
- SLT and LRT have combined to eliminate deaths on the waiting list.
- When comparing outcomes of 43 primary LRT patients with 49 primary SLT patients (including both ex situ and in situ techniques), patient survival rates were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group.
- Graft survival rates were 76% in the SLT group and 81% in the LRT group.
- The incidence of primary nonfunction was lower in the LRT group (2.3%) compared to the SLT group (12%).
- There were no significant differences in liver function parameters or surgical complication rates between the two groups.
- Cold ischemic times were longer in the SLT group, and serum alanine aminotransferase levels were higher in the first postoperative week in the SLT group.

While these findings do not directly address the specific needs of children, they suggest that LRT remains a valuable option, especially considering its lower incidence of primary nonfunction compared to SLT. However, further research specifically focused on pediatric patients would be needed to definitively answer the question regarding the necessity of LRT in children.

In the LRT group, there were more grafts with signs of fatty degeneration than in the SLT group."

Problem:
"Is there still a need for living-related liver transplantation in children?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.
assistant
The provided context does not specifically address the need for living-related liver transplantation (LRT) in children. Instead, it compares split-liver transplantation (SLT) and living-related liver transplantation (LRT) in adults. The study focuses on outcomes such as patient and graft survival rates, incidence of primary nonfunction, liver function parameters, and surgical complications between 43 primary LRT patients and 49 primary SLT patients (including both ex situ and in situ techniques).

Key points from the context that relate to the comparison between SLT and LRT include:

- Both SLT and LRT have improved postoperative graft function and survival.
- The combination of SLT and LRT has eliminated deaths on the waiting list.
- There is no significant difference in outcomes like liver function parameters and surgical complication rates between the two groups.
- SLT had a slightly lower patient survival rate (82%) compared to LRT (88%), but this difference may be due to other factors not addressed in the study.
- SLT had a higher incidence of primary nonfunction (12%) compared to LRT (2.3%).
- SLT had a longer mean cold ischemic time and higher serum values of alanine aminotransferase during the first postoperative week.

While these findings provide insights into the relative merits of SLT and LRT in adults, they do not directly address whether living donor liver transplantation is still necessary for children. To answer the specific question about the need for LRT in children, additional studies focusing on pediatric patients would be required.

You are supposed to summarize the key information from the given context to answer the provided question.

Here is the given context:
"To assess and compare the value of split-liver transplantation (SLT) and living-related liver transplantation (LRT). The concept of SLT results from the development of reduced-size transplantation. A further development of SLT, the in situ split technique, is derived from LRT, which itself marks the optimized outcome in terms of postoperative graft function and survival. The combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, thus raising the question whether living donor liver transplantation is still necessary. Outcomes and postoperative liver function of 43 primary LRT patients were compared with those of 49 primary SLT patients (14 ex situ, 35 in situ) with known graft weight performed between April 1996 and December 2000. Survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. After a median follow-up of 35 months, actual patient survival rates were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group. Actual graft survival rates were 76% and 81%, respectively. The incidence of primary nonfunction was 12% in the SLT group and 2.3% in the LRT group. Liver function parameters (prothrombin time, factor V, bilirubin clearance) and surgical complication rates did not differ significantly. In the SLT group, mean cold ischemic time was longer than in the LRT group. Serum values of alanine aminotransferase during the first postoperative week were significantly higher in the SLT group.

Here is the given context:
"To examine patterns of knowledge and attitudes among adults aged>65 years unvaccinated for influenza. Surveyed Medicare beneficiaries in 5 areas; clustered unvaccinated seniors by their immunization related knowledge and attitudes. Identified 4 clusters: Potentials (45%) would receive influenza vaccine to prevent disease; Fearful Uninformeds (9%) were unsure if influenza vaccine causes illness; Doubters (27%) were unsure if vaccine is efficacious; Misinformeds (19%) believed influenza vaccine causes illness. More Potentials (75%) and Misinformeds (70%) ever received influenza vaccine than did Fearful Uninformeds (18%) and Doubters (29%)."

Problem:
"Do patterns of knowledge and attitudes exist among unvaccinated seniors?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

To answer the question, I will summarize the key information from the given context:

The context states that unvaccinated seniors were clustered into 4 groups based on their knowledge and attitudes towards influenza vaccination. The 4 clusters are:

1. Potentials (45%): willing to receive the influenza vaccine to prevent disease.
2. Fearful Uninformeds (9%): unsure if the vaccine causes illness.
3. Doubters (27%): unsure if the vaccine is efficacious.
4. Misinformeds (19%): believe the vaccine causes illness.

It is also mentioned that:

- More Potentials (75%) and Misinformeds (70%) have a history of receiving the influenza vaccine compared to Fearful Uninformeds (18%) and Doubters (29%).

This information suggests that patterns of knowledge and attitudes do exist among unvaccinated seniors, as they can be grouped into distinct categories based on their understanding and beliefs about the influenza vaccine.

Here is the given context:
"Secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) threatens fragile infants discharged from a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Smoking practices were examined in families with a high respiratory risk infant (born at very low birth weight; ventilated>12 hr) in a Houston, Texas, NICU. Socioeconomic status, race, and mental health status were hypothesized to be related to SHSe and household smoking bans. Data were collected as part of The Baby's Breath Project, a hospital-based SHSe intervention trial targeting parents with a high-risk infant in the NICU who reported a smoker in the household (N = 99). Measures of sociodemographics, smoking, home and car smoking bans, and depression were collected. Overall, 26% of all families with a high-risk infant in the NICU reported a household smoker. Almost half of the families with a smoker reported an annual income of less than $25,000. 46.2% of families reported having a total smoking ban in place in both their homes and cars. Only 27.8% families earning less than $25,000 reported having a total smoking ban in place relative to almost 60% of families earning more (p<.01). African American and Caucasian families were less likely to have a smoking ban compared with Hispanics (p<.05). Mothers who reported no smoking ban were more depressed than those who had a household smoking ban (p<.02)."

Problem:
"Secondhand smoke risk in infants discharged from an NICU: potential for significant health disparities?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.
assistant
The context highlights several aspects related to secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) in infants discharged from a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which can indicate potential for significant health disparities:

1. **Prevalence of Household Smokers**: Among families with high-risk infants (born at very low birth weight and ventilated for more than 12 hours), 26% reported a household smoker. This suggests that SHSe is a common issue among these vulnerable infants.

2. **Socioeconomic Factors**: 
   - **Income**: 46.2% of families with a smoker reported an annual income of less than $25,000, while only 27.8% of these families had a total smoking ban in both their homes and cars. In contrast, 59.6% of families earning more than $25,000 had such bans (p<.01).
   - **Depression**: Mothers who did not have a smoking ban in their homes were more likely to be depressed (p<.02).

3. **Racial Disparities**:
   - **Smoking Bans**: African American and Caucasian families were less likely to have a smoking ban compared to Hispanic families (p<.05).

These findings suggest that socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity play significant roles in the implementation of smoking bans in homes, which could lead to disparities in SHSe exposure and associated health outcomes for infants.

Here is the given context:
"Secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) threatens fragile infants discharged from a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Smoking practices were examined in families with a high respiratory risk infant (born at very low birth weight; ventilated>12 hr) in a Houston, Texas, NICU. Socioeconomic status, race, and mental health status were hypothesized to be related to SHSe and household smoking bans. Data were collected as part of The Baby's Breath Project, a hospital-based SHSe intervention trial targeting parents with a high-risk infant in the NICU who reported a smoker in the household (N = 99). Measures of sociodemographics, smoking, home and car smoking bans, and depression were collected. Overall, 26% of all families with a high-risk infant in the NICU reported a household smoker. Almost half of the families with a smoker reported an annual income of less than $25,000. 46.2% of families reported having a total smoking ban in place in both their homes and cars. Only 27.8% families earning less than $25,000 reported having a total smoking ban in place relative to almost 60% of families earning more (p<.01). African American and Caucasian families were less likely to have a smoking ban compared with Hispanics (p<.05). Mothers who reported no smoking ban were more depressed than those who had a household smoking ban (p<.02)."

The context highlights several aspects related to secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) in infants discharged from a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which can indicate potential for significant health disparities:

1. **Prevalence of Household Smokers**: Among families with high-risk infants (born at very low birth weight and ventilated for more than 12 hours), 26% reported a household smoker. This suggests that SHSe is a common issue among these vulnerable infants.

2. **Socioeconomic Factors**: 
   - **Income**: 46.2% of families with a smoker reported an annual income of less than $25,000, while only 27.8% of these families had a total smoking ban in both their homes and cars. In contrast, 59.6% of families earning more than $25,000 had such bans (p<.01).
   - **Depression**: Mothers who did not have a smoking ban in their homes were more likely to be depressed (p<.02).

3. **Racial Disparities**:
   - **Smoking Bans**: African American and Caucasian families were less likely to have a smoking ban compared to Hispanic families (p<.05).

These findings suggest that socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity play significant roles in the implementation of smoking bans in homes, which could lead to disparities in SHSe exposure and associated health outcomes for infants."

The context highlights several key points regarding secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) risks for infants discharged from a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which could lead to significant health disparities:

1. **Prevalence of Household Smoking**: Among families with high-risk infants (born at very low birth weight and ventilated >12 hours), 26% reported a household smoker. This indicates a substantial portion of these families are exposed to SHSe.

2. **Socioeconomic Disparities**: There is a clear socioeconomic disparity in the presence of smoking bans. Only 27.8% of families earning less than $25,000 had a total smoking ban in both their homes and cars, compared to nearly 60% of families earning more. This suggests that lower-income families are less likely to implement comprehensive smoking bans.

3. **Racial Disparities**: African American and Caucasian families were less likely to have a smoking ban compared to Hispanic families. This further exacerbates the risk of SHSe among certain racial groups.

4. **Mental Health Impact**: Mothers without a smoking ban in place were more likely to report higher levels of depression compared to those with a household smoking ban. This underscores the psychological impact of SHSe on caregivers.

These findings suggest that SHSe poses a significant health risk to infants, particularly in families with lower socioeconomic status and certain racial backgrounds, potentially leading to substantial health disparities.

The context highlights several key points regarding secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) risk in infants discharged from a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which may contribute to significant health disparities:

1. **Prevalence of Household Smokers**: Among families with high-risk infants (very low birth weight, ventilated >12 hours), 26% reported a household smoker. This indicates a notable presence of smoking within these families.

2. **Socioeconomic Disparities**: Families with lower incomes (less than $25,000 annually) were significantly less likely to have a total smoking ban in both their homes and cars. Specifically, only 27.8% of families earning less than $25,000 had a total smoking ban, compared to nearly 60% of families earning more (p < .01).

3. **Racial Disparities**: African American and Caucasian families were less likely to have a smoking ban compared to Hispanic families (p < .05).

4. **Mental Health Impact**: Mothers who reported no smoking ban were more likely to experience depression compared to those who had a household smoking ban (p < .02).

These findings suggest that SHSe poses a significant risk to infants, and there are substantial disparities based on socioeconomic status and race, which could lead to differential health outcomes.

- Mothers who reported no smoking ban were more depressed than those who had a household smoking ban (p<.02).
- These findings suggest that there is a potential for significant health disparities in secondhand smoke exposure among infants discharged from the NICU, particularly among low-income and minority families."

"To assess if the Hawkins sign can predict whether or not astragalus fractures of the neck will develop avascular necrosis. It is also assessed whether the occurrence of this complication is related to the displacement of the fracture, soft tissue injury, or delay in the reduction or surgery. The results were compared with those found in the literature. A retrospective study was conducted on 23 talar neck fractures recorded over a a period of thirteen years. The following variables were analysed: displacement of the fracture, soft tissue injury, delay and type of treatment, complications, observation of the Hawkins sign, and functional outcome. There were 7 type I Hawkins fractures, 11 type II, and 4 type III and 1 type IV. Four cases developed avascular necrosis (2 Hawkins type II and 2 type III). Hawkins sign was observed in 12 cases, of which none developed necrosis. Four cases with negative Hawkins sign developed necrosis.

The Hawkins sign was evaluated to determine its predictive ability for avascular necrosis in fractures of the neck of the astragalus. In a retrospective study of 23 talar neck fractures over 13 years, the presence of the Hawkins sign was observed in 12 cases, none of which developed necrosis. Conversely, four cases without the Hawkins sign did develop necrosis. While no statistically significant differences were found regarding necrosis in relation to fracture displacement, soft tissue injury, or delay in treatment, a statistically significant difference was noted between the presence of the Hawkins sign and the development of avascular necrosis (P=.03). This suggests that the Hawkins sign may have some predictive value for necrosis in these fractures.

The context suggests that the Hawkins sign may have some predictive value for necrosis in fractures of the neck of the astragalus. Specifically:

- Out of 23 talar neck fractures analyzed over 13 years, there were 7 type I, 11 type II, 4 type III, and 1 type IV Hawkins fractures.
- Four cases developed avascular necrosis, with 2 being Hawkins type II and 2 being type III.
- The Hawkins sign was observed in 12 cases, and none of these 12 cases developed necrosis.
- Conversely, 4 cases with a negative Hawkins sign did develop necrosis.
- Statistical analysis indicated that there were differences in the development of avascular necrosis when comparing the presence of the Hawkins sign (P=.03), but no significant differences were found based on fracture displacement, soft tissue injury, or delay in treatment.

This information indicates that the Hawkins sign might be a useful indicator for predicting the risk of developing avascular necrosis in these fractures, although further research would be needed to confirm this finding.

Based on the provided data, the Hawkins sign appears to show a correlation with the development of avascular necrosis, as cases with a positive Hawkins sign did not develop necrosis, while some cases with a negative Hawkins sign did. However, the sample size is relatively small, and more extensive studies would be necessary to establish a definitive predictive value.

Here is the given context:
"To investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions.STUDY DESIGN/ A total of 123 dysphonic individuals with benign vocal pathologies were recruited. They were given either genuine acupuncture (n = 40), sham acupuncture (n = 44), or no treatment (n = 39) for 6 weeks (two 30-minute sessions/wk). The genuine acupuncture group received needles puncturing nine voice-related acupoints for 30 minutes, two times a week for 6 weeks, whereas the sham acupuncture group received blunted needles stimulating the skin surface of the nine acupoints for the same frequency and duration. The no-treatment group did not receive any intervention but attended just the assessment sessions. One-hundred seventeen subjects completed the study (genuine acupuncture = 40; sham acupuncture = 43; and no treatment = 34), but only 84 of them had a complete set of vocal functions and quality of life measures (genuine acupuncture = 29; sham acupuncture = 33; and no-treatment = 22) and 42 of them with a complete set of endoscopic data (genuine acupuncture = 16; sham acupuncture = 15; and no treatment = 11). Significant improvement in vocal function, as indicated by the maximum fundamental frequency produced, and also perceived quality of life, were found in both the genuine and sham acupuncture groups, but not in the no-treatment group. Structural (morphological) improvements were, however, only noticed in the genuine acupuncture group, which demonstrated a significant reduction in the size of the vocal fold lesions."

The study investigated the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions. Participants included 123 dysphonic individuals with benign vocal pathologies, who were randomly assigned to three groups: genuine acupuncture (n = 40), sham acupuncture (n = 44), and no treatment (n = 39). Both the genuine and sham acupuncture groups showed significant improvements in vocal function and perceived quality of life compared to the no-treatment group. However, only the genuine acupuncture group exhibited structural (morphological) improvements, specifically a significant reduction in the size of the vocal fold lesions.

"To investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions.STUDY DESIGN/ A total of 123 dysphonic individuals with benign vocal pathologies were recruited. They were given either genuine acupuncture (n = 40), sham acupuncture (n = 44), or no treatment (n = 39) for 6 weeks (two 30-minute sessions/wk). The genuine acupuncture group received needles puncturing nine voice-related acupoints for 30 minutes, two times a week for 6 weeks, whereas the sham acupuncture group received blunted needles stimulating the skin surface of the nine acupoints for the same frequency and duration. The no-treatment group did not receive any intervention but attended just the assessment sessions. One-hundred seventeen subjects completed the study (genuine acupuncture = 40; sham acupuncture = 43; and no treatment = 34), but only 84 of them had a complete set of vocal functions and quality of life measures (genuine acupuncture = 29; sham acupuncture = 33; and no-treatment = 22) and 42 of them with a complete set of endoscopic data (genuine acupuncture = 16; sham acupuncture = 15; and no treatment = 11). Significant improvement in vocal function, as indicated by the maximum fundamental frequency produced, and also perceived quality of life, were found in both the genuine and sham acupuncture groups, but not in the no-treatment group.

Participants included 123 dysphonic individuals with benign vocal pathologies, who were randomly assigned to three groups: genuine acupuncture (n = 40), sham acupuncture (n = 44), and no treatment (n = 39). Both the genuine and sham acupuncture groups showed significant improvements in vocal function and perceived quality of life compared to the no-treatment group. However, only the genuine acupuncture group exhibited structural (morphological) improvements, specifically a significant reduction in the size of the vocal fold lesions."

The study investigated the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions. It involved 123 dysphonic individuals with benign vocal pathologies, who were randomly assigned to three groups: genuine acupuncture, sham acupuncture, and no treatment. After 6 weeks of treatment (two 30-minute sessions per week), the results showed that both the genuine and sham acupuncture groups experienced significant improvements in vocal function and perceived quality of life compared to the no-treatment group. However, only the genuine acupuncture group showed structural (morphological) improvements, specifically a significant reduction in the size of vocal fold lesions. These findings suggest that while both genuine and sham acupuncture can provide symptomatic relief, genuine acupuncture may also offer some structural benefits in treating phonotraumatic vocal pathologies.

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

The given context investigates the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions. The key information related to the question is as follows:

- 123 dysphonic individuals with benign vocal pathologies were recruited and divided into three groups: genuine acupuncture (n = 40), sham acupuncture (n = 44), and no treatment (n = 39).
- Both genuine and sham acupuncture groups showed significant improvement in vocal function and perceived quality of life after 6 weeks, while the no-treatment group did not show any improvement.
- The genuine acupuncture group demonstrated significant reduction in the size of the vocal fold lesions, indicating structural (morphological) improvements.
- The sham acupuncture group showed improvement in vocal function and quality of life, but no structural improvements were observed.

Based on this information, it can be concluded that both genuine and sham acupuncture may be effective in treating phonotraumatic vocal pathologies in terms of improving vocal function and quality of life. However, genuine acupuncture appears to have an additional benefit of reducing the size of the vocal fold lesions, suggesting structural improvements.

Based on the study results, genuine acupuncture appears to be more efficacious than sham acupuncture for treating phonotraumatic vocal pathologies, particularly in terms of structural improvements. However, both types of acupuncture showed some benefits. Given these findings, it can be concluded that genuine acupuncture has potential efficacy for treating these conditions.

Here is the given context:
"Recent evaluations of IT innovations in primary care have highlighted variations between centres and practices in uptake and use. We evaluated whether structural characteristics of a general practice were associated with variations in use of a web-based clinical information system underpinning a Managed Clinical Network in diabetes, between the years 2001 and 2003. Using a computerised audit trail, we calculated the numbers of web-based operations that occurred in each practice, stratified by staff type and year, and adjusted for the numbers of registered diabetic patients. In regression analyses, we determined whether total use was associated with structural characteristics of the practice (total list size, training status, numbers of GPs (general practitioners), mean age of the GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population and whether staff had received advanced training in diabetes care). Initially there were a few practices which made very frequent use of the information system, with relatively high numbers of practices using the facility infrequently. However, overall use gradually became more evenly spread. This effect was particularly evident among nurse users. Frequent use by GPs was evident in only a small number of practices, with mean GP use decreasing over the three years. In linear regression analyses, none of the general practice variables were associated with online use, either overall or stratified by staff type, except for the numbers of diabetes-educated staff. This was consistently associated with increased use by nurses and GPs."

The context evaluates whether various structural characteristics of general practices influence the uptake of a web-based clinical information system used in diabetes care. The study found that:

- There was initial variation in the use of the information system between practices, with some making frequent use while others used it infrequently.
- Overall use of the system became more evenly distributed over the years, especially among nurse users.
- Mean GP use decreased over the three-year period, indicating that frequent use by GPs was not widespread.
- Linear regression analyses did not find any significant association between general practice characteristics (such as total list size, training status, number of GPs, mean age of GPs, number of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population, and whether staff had received advanced training in diabetes care) and overall use of the system.
- The only characteristic that showed a consistent association with increased use was the number of diabetes-educated staff, which was linked to higher use by both nurses and GPs.

The context describes an evaluation of how various structural characteristics of general practices influenced the uptake of a web-based clinical information system in primary care, specifically within a Managed Clinical Network focused on diabetes care. The study covered the period from 2001 to 2003 and utilized a computerized audit trail to measure the frequency of web-based operations per practice, adjusting for the number of registered diabetic patients.

Key findings related to the question include:

1. **Initial Variability**: At the start, some practices used the information system frequently while others used it infrequently.
   
2. **Trend Over Time**: Overall usage became more evenly distributed over the three-year period, especially among nurse users.

3. **GP Usage**: Frequent use by general practitioners (GPs) was observed in only a small number of practices, and the average GP use decreased over the three years.

4. **Statistical Analysis**: Regression analyses did not find significant associations between general practice characteristics (such as total list size, training status, number of GPs, mean age of GPs, proportion of female GPs, level of population deprivation, and advanced diabetes training) and overall online use, either collectively or when stratified by staff type.

5. **Exception**: The number of diabetes-educated staff members was found to be consistently associated with increased use by both nurses and GPs.

In summary, general practice characteristics did not significantly influence the overall uptake of the IT innovation, except for the presence of diabetes-educated staff, which positively correlated with higher use by both nurses and GPs.

Using a computerised audit trail, we calculated the numbers of web-based operations that occurred in each practice, stratified by staff type and year, and adjusted for the numbers of registered diabetic patients. In regression analyses, we determined whether total use was associated with structural characteristics of the practice (total list size, training status, numbers of GPs (general practitioners), mean age of the GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population and whether staff had received advanced training in diabetes care). Initially there were a few practices which made very frequent use of the information system, with relatively high numbers of practices using the facility infrequently. However, overall use gradually became more evenly spread. This effect was particularly evident among nurse users. Frequent use by GPs was evident in only a small number of practices, with mean GP use decreasing over the three years. In linear regression analyses, none of the general practice variables were associated with online use, either overall or stratified by staff type, except for the numbers of diabetes-educated staff. This was consistently associated with increased use by nurses and GPs."

Problem:
"Do general practice characteristics influence uptake of an information technology (IT) innovation in primary care?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

The key information from the context related to the question is as follows:

- The use of a web-based clinical information system in general practices varied between centers and practices.
- The study found that initially, a few practices used the system frequently, while many used it infrequently, but overall use became more evenly spread over time, especially among nurse users.
- Frequent use by GPs was observed in only a small number of practices, with a decrease in mean GP use over the three years.
- In linear regression analyses, none of the general practice variables (such as total list size, training status, numbers of GPs, mean age of GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population) were associated with online use, except for the numbers of diabetes-educated staff.
- The number of diabetes-educated staff was consistently associated with increased use of the system by both nurses and GPs.

This information suggests that the general practice characteristics do not significantly influence the uptake of the IT innovation, except for the number of diabetes-educated staff, which was found to be positively associated with increased use of the system."

Three northern California family planning clinics. All women with abnormal Pap smear results referred for initial colposcopy and a random sample of those referred for repeated Pap smear. Medical records were located and reviewed for 90 of 107 women referred for colposcopy and 153 of 225 women referred for repeated Pap smears. Routine clinic protocols for follow-up--telephone call, letter, or certified letter--were applied without regard to the type of abnormality seen on a Pap smear or recommended examination.

Attempts to contact the patients for follow-up, adherence to follow-up recommendations, and patient characteristics were abstracted from medical records. The probability of adherence to follow-up vs the number of follow-up attempts was modeled with survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine multivariate relationships related to adherence. The rate of overall adherence to follow-up recommendations was 56.0% (136/243). Adherence to a second colposcopy was not significantly different from that to a repeated Pap smear (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-2.46).

The study examines adherence to follow-up recommendations for women with abnormal Pap smear results. Key findings include:

- Overall adherence to follow-up recommendations was 56.0% (136 out of 243 women).
- There was no significant difference in adherence between follow-up recommendations for a second colposcopy and a repeated Pap smear.
- Using up to three patient reminders significantly improved adherence to follow-up.
- Women without insurance and those attending one of the three clinics were less likely to adhere to follow-up recommendations.

These results suggest that while some follow-up recommendations may be more effective than others, the use of multiple reminders can improve adherence among all patients. However, certain demographic factors like lack of insurance and clinic location appear to negatively impact adherence.

The study aimed to assess adherence to follow-up recommendations for women with abnormal Pap smear results, comparing colposcopy and repeated Pap smear referrals. Of the 243 women included in the analysis (90 referred for colposcopy and 153 for repeated Pap smears), only 56.0% adhered to follow-up recommendations within 8 months of an abnormal result. The odds of adherence did not significantly differ between colposcopy and repeated Pap smear recommendations (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-2.46). However, using up to three patient reminders substantially improved adherence. Additionally, women without insurance and those attending specific clinics were less likely to adhere to follow-up recommendations (hazard ratio for no insurance, 0.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.93]; hazard ratio for clinic, 0.35 [95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.73]).

The study aimed to assess adherence to follow-up recommendations for women with abnormal Pap smear results, comparing colposcopy and repeated Pap smear referrals. Of the 243 women included in the analysis (90 referred for colposcopy and 153 for repeated Pap smears), only 56.0% adhered to follow-up recommendations within 8 months of an abnormal result. The odds of adherence did not significantly differ between colposcopy and repeated Pap smear recommendations (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-2.46). However, using up to three patient reminders substantially improved adherence. Additionally, women without insurance and those attending specific clinics were less likely to adhere to follow-up recommendations (hazard ratio for no insurance, 0.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.93]; hazard ratio for clinic, 0.35 [95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.73])."

The study aimed to assess adherence to follow-up recommendations for colposcopy or repeated Pap smears in women with previously abnormal Pap smear results. Key findings include:

1. **Overall Adherence**: The rate of adherence to follow-up recommendations was 56.0% (136 out of 243 women).

2. **Follow-Up Methods**: Routine clinic protocols for follow-up included telephone calls, letters, or certified letters, applied uniformly regardless of the type of abnormality or recommended examination.

3. **Impact of Multiple Reminders**: Using up to three patient reminders significantly improved adherence to follow-up.

4. **Factors Affecting Adherence**:
   - **Insurance Status**: Women without insurance were less likely to adhere to follow-up recommendations (hazard ratio: 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.20-0.93).
   - **Clinic Location**: Women attending one of the three clinics were also less likely to adhere (hazard ratio: 0.35, 95% confidence interval: 0.15-0.73).

5. **Comparison of Follow-Up Types**: There was no significant difference in adherence between follow-up recommendations for a second colposcopy and a repeated Pap smear (odds ratio: 1.40, 95% confidence interval: 0.80-2.46).

In summary, while follow-up recommendations were made, adherence rates were relatively low at 56%. However, multiple patient reminders increased adherence, and certain demographic factors such as lack of insurance and clinic location influenced adherence negatively.

Here is the given context:
"Telephone counseling and tailored print communications have emerged as promising methods for promoting mammography screening. However, there has been little research testing, within the same randomized field trial, of the efficacy of these two methods compared to a high-quality usual care system for enhancing screening. This study addressed the question: Compared to usual care, is tailored telephone counseling more effective than tailored print materials for promoting mammography screening? Three-year randomized field trial. One thousand ninety-nine women aged 50 and older recruited from a health maintenance organization in North Carolina. Women were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: (1) usual care, (2) tailored print communications, and (3) tailored telephone counseling. Adherence to mammography screening based on self-reports obtained during 1995, 1996, and 1997. Compared to usual care alone, telephone counseling promoted a significantly higher proportion of women having mammograms on schedule (71% vs 61%) than did tailored print (67% vs 61%) but only after the first year of intervention (during 1996). Furthermore, compared to usual care, telephone counseling was more effective than tailored print materials at promoting being on schedule with screening during 1996 and 1997 among women who were off-schedule during the previous year."

Problem:
"Can tailored interventions increase mammography use among HMO women?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.
assistant
The context addresses whether tailored interventions can increase mammography use among women in a health maintenance organization (HMO). Specifically, it compares the effectiveness of tailored telephone counseling and tailored print communications to usual care in promoting mammography screening among women aged 50 and older. 

Key findings include:

1. **Tailored Telephone Counseling vs. Usual Care**: Women receiving tailored telephone counseling had a significantly higher proportion (71%) of those on schedule for mammograms compared to those in the usual care group (61%), particularly after the first year of the intervention (1996).

2. **Tailored Print Materials vs. Usual Care**: Women receiving tailored print materials also showed an increase in mammography use (67% on schedule), but this was not significantly different from the usual care group (61%).

3. **Comparison Between Tailored Interventions**: Tailored telephone counseling was more effective than tailored print materials at increasing mammography use among women who were previously off-schedule, showing a significant difference in adherence to mammography screening during 1996 and 1997.

In summary, tailored interventions, especially tailored telephone counseling, appear to be more effective in increasing mammography use among HMO women compared to usual care and tailored print materials.

"Although observational data support an inverse relationship between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and coronary heart disease (CHD), genetic HDL deficiency states often do not correlate with premature CHD.

In a 1:2 case-control study of sex and age-related (+/-5 y) subjects (n=114), cIMT was nearly identical between cases (0.66+/-0.17 cm) and controls (0.65+/-0.18 cm) despite significantly lower HDL cholesterol (0.67 vs. 1.58 mmol/l) and apolipoprotein A-I levels (96.7 vs. 151.4 mg/dl) (P<0.05)"

The context provides information on a study examining the relationship between low HDL cholesterol due to genetic mutations and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), which is a marker for early atherosclerosis. The study involved 114 participants with 10 different mutations in genes associated with HDL metabolism (LCAT, ABCA1, and APOA1). Despite having significantly lower HDL cholesterol (0.67 mmol/L) and apolipoprotein A-I levels (96.7 mg/dL) compared to controls (1.58 mmol/L and 151.4 mg/dL respectively), the cIMT measurements were nearly identical between cases (0.66 ± 0.17 cm) and controls (0.65 ± 0.18 cm). This suggests that mutations causing low HDL-C do not necessarily promote increased carotid intima-media thickness in this specific context.

These hospitals service an identical demographic area with the latter (NCH) a tertiary referral center. The following outcome measures were used: length of stay, appropriateness of stay, rate of admission to an in-hospital bed, and rate of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge. Adverse events were reported and patient follow-up was attempted at 48 hours after discharge in all cases. The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% (Westmead Hospital) and 14.7% (New Children's Hospital) of admissions, with 56% medical in nature, 30% surgical, and the remainder procedural or psychological. Admission patterns were similar, with asthma, gastroenteritis, convulsion, pneumonia, and simple surgical conditions accounting for most short stay ward admissions. The short stay ward increased hospital efficiency with an average length of stay of 17.5 hours (Westmead Hospital) compared to 20.5 hours (New Children's Hospital).

5. **Safety and Satisfaction**: No adverse events were reported, and parental satisfaction was high.

6. **Resource Utilization**: The short stay wards were established by reallocating resources within the hospitals, leading to estimated savings of $0.5 million to $2.3 million per year due to more efficient bed usage.

Overall, the short stay wards appeared to be effective in managing certain types of pediatric admissions efficiently while maintaining patient safety and satisfaction.

Here is the given context:
"The objective of the current study is to determine to what extent the reduction of Chile's traffic fatalities and injuries during 2000-2012 was related to the police traffic enforcement increment registered after the introduction of its 2005 traffic law reform. A unique dataset with assembled information from public institutions and analyses based on ordinary least square and robust random effects models was carried out. Dependent variables were traffic fatality and severe injury rates per population and vehicle fleet. Independent variables were: (1) presence of new national traffic law; (2) police officers per population; (3) number of traffic tickets per police officer; and (4) interaction effect of number of traffic tickets per police officer with traffic law reform. Oil prices, alcohol consumption, proportion of male population 15-24 years old, unemployment, road infrastructure investment, years' effects and regions' effects represented control variables. Empirical estimates from instrumental variables suggest that the enactment of the traffic law reform in interaction with number of traffic tickets per police officer is significantly associated with a decrease of 8% in traffic fatalities and 7% in severe injuries. Piecewise regression model results for the 2007-2012 period suggest that police traffic enforcement reduced traffic fatalities by 59% and severe injuries by 37%."

Problem:
"Did Chile's traffic law reform push police enforcement?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

The context provides relevant information to answer the question as follows:

- The study found that the interaction effect of the traffic law reform and the number of traffic tickets per police officer was significantly associated with a decrease in traffic fatalities and severe injuries.
- Empirical estimates suggest that this interaction effect resulted in an 8% decrease in traffic fatalities and a 7% decrease in severe injuries.
- A piecewise regression model for the period 2007-2012 showed that police traffic enforcement reduced traffic fatalities by 59% and severe injuries by 37%.

This information suggests that the traffic law reform did have an impact on police enforcement, as the interaction between the law reform and police traffic enforcement led to significant decreases in traffic fatalities and severe injuries.

"Trauma patients who require therapeutic anticoagulation pose a difficult treatment problem. The purpose of this study was to determine: (1) the incidence of complications using therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients, and (2) if any patient factors are associated with these complications. An 18-month retrospective review was performed on trauma patients>or= 15 years old who received therapeutic anticoagulation using unfractionated heparin (UH) and/or fractionated heparin (FH). Forty different pre-treatment and treatment patient characteristics were recorded. Complications of anticoagulation were documented and defined as any unanticipated discontinuation of the anticoagulant for bleeding or other adverse events. One-hundred-fourteen trauma patients were initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation. The most common indication for anticoagulation was deep venous thrombosis (46%). Twenty-four patients (21%) had at least 1 anticoagulation complication. The most common complication was a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring blood transfusion (11 patients). Five patients died (4%), 3 of whom had significant hemorrhage attributed to anticoagulation. Bivariate followed by logistic regression analysis identified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 9.2, 95%CI = 1.5-54.7), UH use (OR = 3.8, 95%CI = 1.1-13.0), and lower initial platelet count (OR = 1.004, 95%CI = 1.000-1.008) as being associated with complications.

The study examines the safety of therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients. Key findings include:

- Among 114 trauma patients initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation, 21% experienced at least one complication.
- Common complications included a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring blood transfusion.
- Five patients died, three due to significant hemorrhage attributed to anticoagulation.
- Factors associated with complications through bivariate and logistic regression analysis were:
  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 9.2, 95% CI = 1.5-54.7)
  - Unfractionated heparin (UH) use (OR = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.1-13.0)
  - Lower initial platelet count (OR = 1.004, 95% CI = 1.000-1.008)

These results suggest that while therapeutic anticoagulation can be necessary for trauma patients, it is not without risk, particularly in certain patient subgroups.

The study examines the safety of therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients and identifies certain risk factors. Key points include:

1. **Incidence of Complications**: Out of 114 trauma patients who received anticoagulation, 24 (21%) experienced at least one complication.
   
2. **Common Complications**: The most frequent complication was a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring a blood transfusion, affecting 11 patients. Additionally, five patients died, three of whom had significant hemorrhage attributed to anticoagulation.

3. **Risk Factors Identified**:
   - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): Patients with COPD had a significantly higher risk (OR = 9.2, 95% CI = 1.5-54.7).
   - Unfractionated heparin (UH) use: Patients receiving UH were more likely to experience complications compared to those receiving fractionated heparin (FH) (OR = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.1-13.0).
   - Lower initial platelet count: A slightly increased risk was noted with each unit decrease in initial platelet count (OR = 1.004, 95% CI = 1.000-1.008).

4. **Anticoagulant Types**: There were differences between patients receiving UH versus FH, including variations in laboratory values and anticoagulation indications.

In summary, while therapeutic anticoagulation can be necessary for trauma patients, it carries risks, particularly in those with COPD, those receiving UH, and those with lower initial platelet counts. The overall safety profile appears to be less favorable when using UH compared to FH.

Medical records of a cohort of community-based primary care patients, aged 35 to 65 years, who previously participated in our Family Healthware study and had a moderate or strong familial risk for any of the 6 diseases were subsequently reviewed. The main outcome measures were PCP response to the prompts, adding family history risk to problem summary lists, and patient screening status for each disease. The 492 eligible patients had 847 visits during the study period; 152 visits had no documentation of response to a family history prompt.

The study aimed to determine if automated, at-the-visit tailored prompts about family history risk would change primary care provider (PCP) behavior. These prompts highlighted familial risk for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. The research involved 492 eligible patients aged 35 to 65 years with a moderate or strong familial risk for one of six diseases, over 847 visits during 2011 to 2012. 

Key findings include:
- 152 visits (18%) had no documentation of a response to a family history prompt.
- Of the remaining 695 visits, 53.5% of visits saw the PCP review family history, 22.9% discussed it, 22.3% did not address it, and only 0.7% resulted in both a review of family history and ordering of tests or referrals.
- There was no significant change in the documentation of risk status in problem summary lists or in the implementation of screening interventions for any of the six diseases.

Overall, the study suggests that while prompts were recognized by PCPs, there was no substantial change in how they documented or acted on family history risk information.

The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of EUS fellowships on emergency medicine (EM) residents' US education. We conducted a cross-sectional study at 9 academic medical centers. A questionnaire on US education and bedside US use was pilot tested and given to EM residents. The primary outcomes included the number of US examinations performed, scope of bedside US applications, barriers to residents' US education, and US use in the emergency department. The secondary outcomes were factors that would impact residents' US education. The outcomes were compared between residency programs with and without EUS fellowships. A total of 244 EM residents participated in this study. Thirty percent (95% confidence interval, 24%-35%) reported they had performed more than 150 scans. Residents in programs with EUS fellowships reported performing more scans than those in programs without fellowships (P = .04).

"To assess and compare the value of split-liver transplantation (SLT) and living-related liver transplantation (LRT). The concept of SLT results from the development of reduced-size transplantation. A further development of SLT, the in situ split technique, is derived from LRT, which itself marks the optimized outcome in terms of postoperative graft function and survival. The combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, thus raising the question whether living donor liver transplantation is still necessary. Outcomes and postoperative liver function of 43 primary LRT patients were compared with those of 49 primary SLT patients (14 ex situ, 35 in situ) with known graft weight performed between April 1996 and December 2000. Survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. After a median follow-up of 35 months, actual patient survival rates were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group. Actual graft survival rates were 76% and 81%, respectively. The incidence of primary nonfunction was 12% in the SLT group and 2.3% in the LRT group. Liver function parameters (prothrombin time, factor V, bilirubin clearance) and surgical complication rates did not differ significantly. In the SLT group, mean cold ischemic time was longer than in the LRT group. Serum values of alanine aminotransferase during the first postoperative week were significantly higher in the SLT group.

The context provides information on a study comparing the outcomes of split-liver transplantation (SLT) and living-related liver transplantation (LRT) in patients. The key points related to the question "Is there still a need for living-related liver transplantation in children?" are:

- The actual patient survival rates after a median follow-up of 35 months were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group.
- The actual graft survival rates were 76% in the SLT group and 81% in the LRT group.
- The incidence of primary nonfunction was higher in the SLT group (12%) compared to the LRT group (2.3%).
- Liver function parameters and surgical complication rates did not differ significantly between the two groups.
- The study suggests that the combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, raising the question whether LRT is still necessary.

Considering these points, the study does not provide a clear answer to whether living-related liver transplantation is still necessary. However, it implies that the outcomes of SLT have improved to a point where it may be a viable alternative to LRT, potentially reducing the need for living donor liver transplantation.

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

To answer the question, we need to look at the key points from the context:

1. The combination of split-liver transplantation (SLT) and living-related liver transplantation (LRT) has abolished deaths on the waiting list.
2. The actual patient survival rates after a median follow-up of 35 months were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group.
3. The actual graft survival rates were 76% in the SLT group and 81% in the LRT group.
4. The incidence of primary nonfunction was 12% in the SLT group and 2.3% in the LRT group.
5. Liver function parameters and surgical complication rates did not differ significantly between the two groups.
6. Mean cold ischemic time was longer in the SLT group.
7. Serum values of alanine aminotransferase during the first postoperative week were higher in the SLT group.
8. There were more grafts with signs of fatty degeneration in the LRT group.

Based on these points, it can be concluded that both SLT and LRT have similar outcomes in terms of patient and graft survival rates, liver function, and surgical complications. However, LRT has a lower incidence of primary nonfunction. Considering these results, the question remains whether there is still a need for living-related liver transplantation in children, as SLT has been able to abolish deaths on the waiting list.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of elevated RHR and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to investigate any associations between RHR and these risk factors in a rural population in Ghana. Cross-sectional analysis. A total of 574 adults aged between 18-65 years were randomly sampled from a population register. Data collected included those on sociodemographic variables and anthropometric, blood pressure (BP), and RHR measurements. Within-person variability in RHR was calculated using data from repeat measurements taken 2 weeks apart. Of study participants, 36% were male. Prevalence of casual high BP was 19%. In the population, 10% were current cigarette smokers and habitual alcohol use was high at 56%. As measured by body mass index, 2% were obese and 14% had abdominal obesity. RHR was elevated (>90 bpm) in 19%. Overall, 79% of study participants were found to have at least one CVD risk factor. RHR was significantly associated with age, waist circumference, and BP. Individuals with an elevated RHR had a higher risk (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.15-3.26%, p = 0.013) of casual high BP compared with participants with normal RHR independently of several established CVD risk factors.

   - Individuals with elevated RHR had a higher risk (Odds Ratio 1.94, 95% CI 1.15-3.26, p = 0.013) of having casual high blood pressure, independent of other established cardiovascular risk factors.
4. **Within-Person Variability**: The within-person variability in RHR was calculated using repeat measurements taken 2 weeks apart.
5. **Sample Demographics**: The study included 574 adults aged 18-65 years, with 36% being male.

These results suggest that elevated RHR is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease in this rural West African population, highlighting its importance in assessing cardiovascular risk.

"Elevated resting heart rate (RHR) is a neglected marker in cardiovascular risk factor studies of sub-Saharan African populations. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of elevated RHR and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to investigate any associations between RHR and these risk factors in a rural population in Ghana. Cross-sectional analysis. A total of 574 adults aged between 18-65 years were randomly sampled from a population register. Data collected included those on sociodemographic variables and anthropometric, blood pressure (BP), and RHR measurements. Within-person variability in RHR was calculated using data from repeat measurements taken 2 weeks apart. Of study participants, 36% were male. Prevalence of casual high BP was 19%. In the population, 10% were current cigarette smokers and habitual alcohol use was high at 56%. As measured by body mass index, 2% were obese and 14% had abdominal obesity. RHR was elevated (>90 bpm) in 19%. Overall, 79% of study participants were found to have at least one CVD risk factor. RHR was significantly associated with age, waist circumference, and BP. Individuals with an elevated RHR had a higher risk (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.15-3.26%, p = 0.013) of casual high BP compared with participants with normal RHR independently of several established CVD risk factors. The regression dilution ratio of RHR was 0.75 (95% CI 0.62-0.89)."

"Secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) threatens fragile infants discharged from a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Smoking practices were examined in families with a high respiratory risk infant (born at very low birth weight; ventilated>12 hr) in a Houston, Texas, NICU. Socioeconomic status, race, and mental health status were hypothesized to be related to SHSe and household smoking bans. Data were collected as part of The Baby's Breath Project, a hospital-based SHSe intervention trial targeting parents with a high-risk infant in the NICU who reported a smoker in the household (N = 99). Measures of sociodemographics, smoking, home and car smoking bans, and depression were collected. Overall, 26% of all families with a high-risk infant in the NICU reported a household smoker. Almost half of the families with a smoker reported an annual income of less than $25,000. 46.2% of families reported having a total smoking ban in place in both their homes and cars. Only 27.8% families earning less than $25,000 reported having a total smoking ban in place relative to almost 60% of families earning more (p<.01). African American and Caucasian families were less likely to have a smoking ban compared with Hispanics (p<.05).

A population based cross-sectional study of 4200 randomly selected adults registered with a General Medical Practice in North West, England. The study examined the association of chronic oro-facial pain with a variety of self-reported mechanical factors: teeth grinding, facial trauma, missing teeth and the feeling that the teeth did not fit together properly. Information was also collected on demographic factors, psychological factors and the reporting of other frequently unexplained syndromes. An adjusted response rate of 72% was achieved. Only two mechanical factors: teeth grinding (odds ratio (OR) 2.0, 95% CI 1.3-3.0) and facial trauma (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.3-2.9) were independently associated with chronic oro-facial pain after adjusting for psychological factors.

To answer the question, I will summarize the key information from the given context:

- The study investigated the association between self-reported mechanical factors and chronic oro-facial pain.
- Only two mechanical factors were independently associated with chronic oro-facial pain: teeth grinding and facial trauma, after adjusting for psychological factors.
- These two factors were also commonly associated with the reporting of other frequently unexplained syndromes, indicating a possible common underlying factor.
- The study found a strong association between teeth grinding and facial trauma with the reporting of other unexplained syndromes, suggesting that these mechanical factors might be related to somatisation (exaggerated or distorted reports of physical symptoms).

Based on this information, the answer to the question is: Yes, reports of mechanical dysfunction in chronic oro-facial pain are related to somatisation, as they are associated with the reporting of other unexplained syndromes.

The following variables were analysed: displacement of the fracture, soft tissue injury, delay and type of treatment, complications, observation of the Hawkins sign, and functional outcome. There were 7 type I Hawkins fractures, 11 type II, and 4 type III and 1 type IV. Four cases developed avascular necrosis (2 Hawkins type II and 2 type III). Hawkins sign was observed in 12 cases, of which none developed necrosis. Four cases with negative Hawkins sign developed necrosis.

The Hawkins sign was evaluated for its ability to predict the development of avascular necrosis in fractures of the neck of the astragalus. In a retrospective study involving 23 talar neck fractures over a period of thirteen years, the presence of the Hawkins sign was analyzed alongside other factors such as fracture displacement, soft tissue injury, delay in treatment, and type of treatment. 

Key findings include:
- Out of 23 cases, the Hawkins sign was observed in 12 cases, none of which developed necrosis.
- Four cases without a positive Hawkins sign did develop necrosis.
- No statistically significant differences were found regarding necrosis based on fracture displacement, soft tissue injury, or delay in treatment.
- A statistically significant difference was found between the development of avascular necrosis and the presence of the Hawkins sign (P=.03).

These results suggest that the Hawkins sign may be a useful predictor of necrosis in these fractures, as cases with a negative Hawkins sign had a higher incidence of necrosis compared to those with a positive sign.

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.
assistant
The context suggests that the Hawkins sign may have some predictive value for avascular necrosis in fractures of the neck of the astragalus. Specifically:

- Out of 23 talar neck fractures analyzed over 13 years, 4 cases developed avascular necrosis.
- Of the 12 cases where the Hawkins sign was observed, none developed necrosis.
- In contrast, 4 cases with a negative Hawkins sign did develop necrosis.
- Statistical analysis indicated a significant difference in the development of avascular necrosis when comparing the presence or absence of the Hawkins sign (P=.03).

While other factors like fracture displacement, soft tissue injury, and delay in treatment did not show significant differences in predicting necrosis, the Hawkins sign showed a potential predictive capability. However, further research would be needed to confirm these findings.

The genuine acupuncture group received needles puncturing nine voice-related acupoints for 30 minutes, two times a week for 6 weeks, whereas the sham acupuncture group received blunted needles stimulating the skin surface of the nine acupoints for the same frequency and duration. The no-treatment group did not receive any intervention but attended just the assessment sessions. One-hundred seventeen subjects completed the study (genuine acupuncture = 40; sham acupuncture = 43; and no treatment = 34), but only 84 of them had a complete set of vocal functions and quality of life measures (genuine acupuncture = 29; sham acupuncture = 33; and no-treatment = 22) and 42 of them with a complete set of endoscopic data (genuine acupuncture = 16; sham acupuncture = 15; and no treatment = 11). Significant improvement in vocal function, as indicated by the maximum fundamental frequency produced, and also perceived quality of life, were found in both the genuine and sham acupuncture groups, but not in the no-treatment group.

"Recent evaluations of IT innovations in primary care have highlighted variations between centres and practices in uptake and use. We evaluated whether structural characteristics of a general practice were associated with variations in use of a web-based clinical information system underpinning a Managed Clinical Network in diabetes, between the years 2001 and 2003. Using a computerised audit trail, we calculated the numbers of web-based operations that occurred in each practice, stratified by staff type and year, and adjusted for the numbers of registered diabetic patients. In regression analyses, we determined whether total use was associated with structural characteristics of the practice (total list size, training status, numbers of GPs (general practitioners), mean age of the GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population and whether staff had received advanced training in diabetes care). Initially there were a few practices which made very frequent use of the information system, with relatively high numbers of practices using the facility infrequently. However, overall use gradually became more evenly spread. This effect was particularly evident among nurse users. Frequent use by GPs was evident in only a small number of practices, with mean GP use decreasing over the three years. In linear regression analyses, none of the general practice variables were associated with online use, either overall or stratified by staff type, except for the numbers of diabetes-educated staff. This was consistently associated with increased use by nurses and GPs."

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

According to the context, the study evaluated the association between structural characteristics of general practices and the use of a web-based clinical information system in diabetes care. The key findings are:

- Initially, there were significant variations in the use of the information system, with some practices using it frequently and others infrequently.
- However, overall use became more evenly spread over time.
- Frequent use by GPs was observed in only a small number of practices, with a decrease in mean GP use over the three years.
- In linear regression analyses, none of the general practice variables (such as total list size, training status, numbers of GPs, mean age of GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population) were associated with online use, except for the numbers of diabetes-educated staff.
- The number of diabetes-educated staff was consistently associated with increased use of the information system by both nurses and GPs.

Based on these findings, the answer to the problem is: No, general practice characteristics do not influence the uptake of the IT innovation, except for the number of diabetes-educated staff, which is associated with increased use of the information system.

Here is the given context:
"Recent evaluations of IT innovations in primary care have highlighted variations between centres and practices in uptake and use. We evaluated whether structural characteristics of a general practice were associated with variations in use of a web-based clinical information system underpinning a Managed Clinical Network in diabetes, between the years 2001 and 2003. Using a computerised audit trail, we calculated the numbers of web-based operations that occurred in each practice, stratified by staff type and year, and adjusted for the numbers of registered diabetic patients. In regression analyses, we determined whether total use was associated with structural characteristics of the practice (total list size, training status, numbers of GPs (general practitioners), mean age of the GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population and whether staff had received advanced training in diabetes care). Initially there were a few practices which made very frequent use of the information system, with relatively high numbers of practices using the facility infrequently. However, overall use gradually became more evenly spread. This effect was particularly evident among nurse users. Frequent use by GPs was evident in only a small number of practices, with mean GP use decreasing over the three years. In linear regression analyses, none of the general practice variables were associated with online use, either overall or stratified by staff type, except for the numbers of diabetes-educated staff. This was consistently associated with increased use by nurses and GPs."

Problem:
"Do general practice characteristics influence uptake of an information technology (IT) innovation in primary care?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

The key information from the context related to the question is as follows:

- There were variations in the use of a web-based clinical information system among general practices, with some practices using it frequently and others infrequently.
- The use of the system became more evenly spread over the three years, particularly among nurse users.
- Frequent use by GPs was observed in only a small number of practices, with a decrease in mean GP use over the three years.
- In linear regression analyses, none of the general practice variables (such as total list size, training status, numbers of GPs, mean age of GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population) were associated with online use, except for one variable.
- The exception was the number of diabetes-educated staff, which was consistently associated with increased use by both nurses and GPs.

This information suggests that the characteristics of the general practice itself do not seem to have a significant impact on the uptake of the IT innovation, except for the number of diabetes-educated staff, which is positively associated with increased use.

"To compare adherence to follow-up recommendations for colposcopy or repeated Papanicolaou (Pap) smears for women with previously abnormal Pap smear results. Retrospective cohort study. Three northern California family planning clinics. All women with abnormal Pap smear results referred for initial colposcopy and a random sample of those referred for repeated Pap smear. Medical records were located and reviewed for 90 of 107 women referred for colposcopy and 153 of 225 women referred for repeated Pap smears. Routine clinic protocols for follow-up--telephone call, letter, or certified letter--were applied without regard to the type of abnormality seen on a Pap smear or recommended examination. Documented adherence to follow-up within 8 months of an abnormal result. Attempts to contact the patients for follow-up, adherence to follow-up recommendations, and patient characteristics were abstracted from medical records. The probability of adherence to follow-up vs the number of follow-up attempts was modeled with survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine multivariate relationships related to adherence. The rate of overall adherence to follow-up recommendations was 56.0% (136/243). Adherence to a second colposcopy was not significantly different from that to a repeated Pap smear (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-2.46). The use of as many as 3 patient reminders substantially improved adherence to follow-up. Women without insurance and women attending 1 of the 3 clinics were less likely to adhere to any follow-up recommendation (hazard ratio for no insurance, 0.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.93], and for clinic, 0.35 [95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.73])."

The given context is about a study examining the adherence to follow-up recommendations for women with abnormal Pap smear results. Here's a summary of the relevant information related to the question:

- The study found that the overall adherence to follow-up recommendations was 56.0% (136/243).
- Adherence to a second colposcopy was not significantly different from that to a repeated Pap smear (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-2.46).
- The use of as many as 3 patient reminders substantially improved adherence to follow-up.
- Women without insurance and women attending 1 of the 3 clinics were less likely to adhere to any follow-up recommendation.

These findings suggest that the follow-up recommendations themselves do not have a significant impact on patient adherence, as adherence rates were similar for colposcopy and repeated Pap smears. However, the use of reminders and other factors such as insurance status and clinic attendance do influence adherence to follow-up recommendations.

"Compared with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) may have additional value in the assessment of primary and recurrent cervical cancer. However, the degree of tumour uptake of (18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -glucose (FDG) uptake is sometimes influenced by diabetes mellitus (DM). Therefore, we conducted this prospective study to compare the diagnostic ability of FDG-PET in patients with cervical cancer complicated by DM and those without DM. Patients with untreated locally advanced primary or clinically curable recurrent cervical carcinoma were enrolled. Both FDG-PET and MRI/CT scans were performed within 2 weeks. Patients were categorised into the following groups: hyperglycaemic DM (fasting blood sugar>126 mg/dl), euglycaemic DM and non-DM. The lesions were confirmed histologically or by clinical follow-up. The receiver operating characteristic curve method, with calculation of the area under the curve (AUC), was used to evaluate the discriminative power. From February 2001 to January 2003, 219 patients (75 with primary and 144 with recurrent cervical cancer) were eligible for analysis. Sixteen had hyperglycaemic DM, 12 had euglycaemic DM and 191 were in the non-DM group. The diagnostic power of PET in the hyperglycaemic DM, euglycaemic DM and non-DM groups did not differ significantly with regard to the identification of either metastatic lesions (AUC, 0.967/0.947/0.925, P>0.05) or primary tumours/local recurrence (AUC, 0.950/0.938/0.979, P>0.05). Considering all DM patients, PET showed a significantly higher detection power than MRI/CT scans in respect of metastatic lesions (AUC=0.956 vs 0.824, P=0.012)."

Adherence to mammography screening based on self-reports obtained during 1995, 1996, and 1997. Compared to usual care alone, telephone counseling promoted a significantly higher proportion of women having mammograms on schedule (71% vs 61%) than did tailored print (67% vs 61%) but only after the first year of intervention (during 1996). Furthermore, compared to usual care, telephone counseling was more effective than tailored print materials at promoting being on schedule with screening during 1996 and 1997 among women who were off-schedule during the previous year."

The context addresses whether tailored interventions can increase mammography use among women in a health maintenance organization (HMO). Specifically, it compares the effectiveness of tailored telephone counseling and tailored print communications to usual care in promoting mammography screening among women aged 50 and older. 

Key findings include:

1. **Tailored Telephone Counseling vs. Usual Care**: Women receiving tailored telephone counseling had a significantly higher proportion (71%) of those on schedule for mammograms compared to those in the usual care group (61%), particularly after the first year of the intervention (1996).

2. **Tailored Print Materials vs. Usual Care**: Women receiving tailored print materials also showed an increase in mammography use (67% on schedule), but this was not significantly different from the usual care group (61%).

3. **Comparison Between Tailored Interventions**: Tailored telephone counseling was more effective than tailored print materials at increasing mammography use among women who were previously off-schedule, showing a significant difference in adherence to mammography screening during 1996 and 1997.

In summary, tailored interventions, especially tailored telephone counseling, appear to be more effective in increasing mammography use among HMO women compared to usual care and tailored print materials."

Problem:
"Can tailored interventions increase mammography use among HMO women?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.
assistant
The context describes a study that investigated whether tailored interventions could increase mammography use among women aged 50 and older from a health maintenance organization (HMO) in North Carolina. The study compared three groups: usual care, tailored print communications, and tailored telephone counseling. Key findings relevant to the question are:

- Tailored telephone counseling was found to be more effective than tailored print materials in promoting mammography screening.
- Specifically, telephone counseling increased the proportion of women having mammograms on schedule to 71%, compared to 61% in the usual care group and 67% in the tailored print group.
- These effects were most pronounced in the second and third years of the intervention, where telephone counseling showed a significant advantage over both usual care and tailored print materials in keeping women on schedule with their mammograms, particularly among those who were previously off-schedule.

Overall, the study suggests that tailored telephone counseling can be an effective strategy to increase mammography use among HMO women, outperforming tailored print materials in this regard."

The study investigated whether tailored interventions could increase mammography use among women aged 50 and older from a health maintenance organization (HMO) in North Carolina. Specifically, it compared the effectiveness of tailored telephone counseling and tailored print communications against usual care. The key findings are:

1. **Tailored Telephone Counseling vs. Usual Care**: Women receiving tailored telephone counseling had a significantly higher adherence rate to mammography screening compared to those receiving usual care (71% vs. 61%).

2. **Tailored Print Materials vs. Usual Care**: Women receiving tailored print materials also showed increased adherence to mammography screening compared to those receiving usual care (67% vs. 61%), but this effect was less pronounced and only significant after the first year of the intervention.

3. **Comparison Between Tailored Interventions**: Tailored telephone counseling was more effective than tailored print materials at promoting timely mammography screening among women who were previously off-schedule. This difference was observed during both 1996 and 1997.

In summary, tailored interventions, particularly telephone counseling, can increase mammography use among HMO women, with telephone counseling showing a more pronounced and sustained effect compared to tailored print materials."

You are supposed to summarize the key information from the given context to answer the provided question.

Here is the given context:
"From March 2007 to January 2011, 88 DBE procedures were performed on 66 patients. Indications included evaluation anemia/gastrointestinal bleed, small bowel IBD and dilation of strictures. Video-capsule endoscopy (VCE) was used prior to DBE in 43 of the 66 patients prior to DBE evaluation. The mean age was 62 years. Thirty-two patients were female, 15 were African-American; 44 antegrade and 44 retrograde DBEs were performed. The mean time per antegrade DBE was 107.4±30.0 minutes with a distance of 318.4±152.9 cm reached past the pylorus. The mean time per lower DBE was 100.7±27.3 minutes with 168.9±109.1 cm meters past the ileocecal valve reached. Endoscopic therapy in the form of electrocautery to ablate bleeding sources was performed in 20 patients (30.3%), biopsy in 17 patients (25.8%) and dilation of Crohn's-related small bowel strictures in 4 (6.1%). 43 VCEs with pathology noted were performed prior to DBE, with findings endoscopically confirmed in 32 cases (74.4%). In 3 cases the DBE showed findings not noted on VCE."

"Double balloon enteroscopy: is it efficacious and safe in a community setting?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

To answer the question of whether double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) is efficacious and safe in a community setting, the relevant information from the context can be summarized as follows:

**Efficacy:**

- DBE was used to evaluate anemia/gastrointestinal bleed, small bowel IBD, and dilation of strictures in 66 patients.
- Endoscopic therapy (electrocautery, biopsy, and stricture dilation) was performed in 41 patients (61.4% of the total).
- Pathology findings from video-capsule endoscopy (VCE) were confirmed in 74.4% of the cases.

**Safety:**

- The procedure was performed on 88 patients over a period of 4 years, indicating a manageable workload in a community setting.
- The mean time per antegrade DBE was 107.4 minutes, and the mean time per retrograde DBE was 100.7 minutes, suggesting a feasible procedure time.
- The distance reached past the pylorus (318.4 cm) and past the ileocecal valve (168.9 cm) indicates the ability to effectively access the small bowel.

Overall, the data suggests that DBE is a viable option for evaluating and treating small bowel disorders in a community setting, with a good balance between efficacy and safety."

Here is the given context:
"Although observational data support an inverse relationship between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and coronary heart disease (CHD), genetic HDL deficiency states often do not correlate with premature CHD. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) measurements were obtained in cases comprising 10 different mutations in LCAT, ABCA1 and APOA1 to further evaluate the relationship between low HDL resulting from genetic variation and early atherosclerosis. In a 1:2 case-control study of sex and age-related (+/-5 y) subjects (n=114), cIMT was nearly identical between cases (0.66+/-0.17 cm) and controls (0.65+/-0.18 cm) despite significantly lower HDL cholesterol (0.67 vs. 1.58 mmol/l) and apolipoprotein A-I levels (96.7 vs. 151.4 mg/dl) (P<0.05)"

The context provides information on a study examining the relationship between low HDL cholesterol due to genetic mutations and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), which is a marker for early atherosclerosis. The study involved 114 participants with 10 different mutations in genes associated with HDL metabolism (LCAT, ABCA1, and APOA1). Despite having significantly lower HDL cholesterol (0.67 mmol/L) and apolipoprotein A-I levels (96.7 mg/dL) compared to controls (1.58 mmol/L and 151.4 mg/dL respectively), the cIMT measurements were nearly identical between cases (0.66 ± 0.17 cm) and controls (0.65 ± 0.18 cm).

In a 1:2 case-control study of sex and age-related (+/-5 y) subjects (n=114), cIMT was nearly identical between cases (0.66+/-0.17 cm) and controls (0.65+/-0.18 cm) despite significantly lower HDL cholesterol (0.67 vs. 1.58 mmol/l) and apolipoprotein A-I levels (96.7 vs. 151.4 mg/dl) (P<0.05)"

Problem:
"Do mutations causing low HDL-C promote increased carotid intima-media thickness?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.
assistant
The context provides information on a study that investigated whether mutations causing low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) promote increased carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), an indicator of early atherosclerosis. The study involved 114 participants who had 10 different mutations in genes associated with low HDL, including LCAT, ABCA1, and APOA1. Despite having significantly lower HDL cholesterol levels (0.67 mmol/L) and apolipoprotein A-I levels (96.7 mg/dL) compared to controls (1.58 mmol/L and 151.4 mg/dL respectively), the cIMT measurements were similar between cases (0.66 ± 0.17 cm) and controls (0.65 ± 0.18 cm). This suggests that mutations leading to low HDL-C do not necessarily promote increased carotid intima-media thickness in this context."

"We evaluated the usefulness of a short stay or 23-hour ward in a pediatric unit of a large teaching hospital, Westmead Hospital, and an academic Children's hospital, The New Children's Hospital, to determine if they are a useful addition to the emergency service. This is a descriptive comparison of prospectively collected data on all children admitted to the short stay ward at Westmead Hospital (WH) during 1994 and the short stay ward at the New Children's Hospital (NCH) during 1997-98. These hospitals service an identical demographic area with the latter (NCH) a tertiary referral center. The following outcome measures were used: length of stay, appropriateness of stay, rate of admission to an in-hospital bed, and rate of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge. Adverse events were reported and patient follow-up was attempted at 48 hours after discharge in all cases. The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% (Westmead Hospital) and 14.7% (New Children's Hospital) of admissions, with 56% medical in nature, 30% surgical, and the remainder procedural or psychological. Admission patterns were similar, with asthma, gastroenteritis, convulsion, pneumonia, and simple surgical conditions accounting for most short stay ward admissions. The short stay ward increased hospital efficiency with an average length of stay of 17.5 hours (Westmead Hospital) compared to 20.5 hours (New Children's Hospital). The users of the short stay ward were children of young age less than 2 years, with stay greater than 23 hours reported in only 1% of all admissions to the short stay ward. The rate of patient admission to an in-hospital bed was low, (4% [Westmead Hospital] compared to 6% [New Children's Hospital]), with the number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of short stay ward discharge less than 1%. There were no adverse events reported at either short stay ward, with parental satisfaction high. The short stay ward was developed through reallocation of resources from within the hospital to the short stay ward. This resulted in estimated savings of $1/2 million (Westmead Hospital) to $2.3 million (New Children's Hospital) to the hospital, due to more efficient bed usage."

The study evaluated the effectiveness of short stay or 23-hour wards in two pediatric units: Westmead Hospital and The New Children's Hospital. Both hospitals serve an identical demographic area, with the latter being a tertiary referral center. Key findings include:

1. **Admission Patterns**: 
   - 56% of admissions were medical, 30% were surgical, and the remaining were procedural or psychological.
   - Common conditions leading to admissions included asthma, gastroenteritis, convulsions, pneumonia, and simple surgical cases.

2. **Length of Stay**:
   - The average length of stay was 17.5 hours at Westmead Hospital and 20.5 hours at The New Children's Hospital.

3. **Utilization and Efficiency**:
   - The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% of admissions at Westmead Hospital and 14.7% at The New Children's Hospital.
   - Only 1% of admissions lasted longer than 23 hours.
   - The rate of patients requiring admission to an in-hospital bed was low: 4% at Westmead Hospital and 6% at The New Children's Hospital.
   - The rate of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge was less than 1%.

4. **Safety and Satisfaction**:
   - No adverse events were reported.
   - Parental satisfaction was high.

5. **Cost and Resource Utilization**:
   - The short stay ward was developed by reallocating resources from within the hospital.
   - Estimated savings ranged from $0.5 million to $2.3 million per year due to more efficient bed usage.

Overall, the short stay wards were found to be effective in increasing hospital efficiency while maintaining patient safety and satisfaction."

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.
assistant
The study evaluated the effectiveness of short stay or 23-hour wards in two pediatric units: one at Westmead Hospital and another at The New Children's Hospital. Both hospitals serve an identical demographic area, with The New Children's Hospital being a tertiary referral center. Key findings include:

1. **Admissions**: 
   - The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% of admissions at Westmead Hospital and 14.7% at The New Children's Hospital.
   - Medical admissions made up 56%, surgical admissions 30%, and the rest were procedural or psychological.
   
2. **Patient Demographics**:
   - Most admissions were of children under 2 years old.
   - Only 1% of admissions lasted longer than 23 hours.

3. **Length of Stay**:
   - Average length of stay was 17.5 hours at Westmead Hospital and 20.5 hours at The New Children's Hospital.

4. **Utilization**:
   - The rate of patients needing an in-hospital bed was low, at 4% for Westmead Hospital and 6% for The New Children's Hospital.
   - Less than 1% of patients had unscheduled visits within 72 hours post-discharge.

5. **Safety and Satisfaction**:
   - No adverse events were reported.
   - Parental satisfaction was high.

6. **Cost Efficiency**:
   - The short stay ward led to more efficient bed usage.
   - Estimated savings ranged from $0.5 million to $2.3 million per year for each hospital.

Overall, the short stay wards were found to be effective in improving hospital efficiency and patient outcomes while maintaining high levels of safety and satisfaction."

"We evaluated the usefulness of a short stay or 23-hour ward in a pediatric unit of a large teaching hospital, Westmead Hospital, and an academic Children's hospital, The New Children's Hospital, to determine if they are a useful addition to the emergency service. This is a descriptive comparison of prospectively collected data on all children admitted to the short stay ward at Westmead Hospital (WH) during 1994 and the short stay ward at the New Children's Hospital (NCH) during 1997-98. These hospitals service an identical demographic area with the latter (NCH) a tertiary referral center. The following outcome measures were used: length of stay, appropriateness of stay, rate of admission to an in-hospital bed, and rate of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge. Adverse events were reported and patient follow-up was attempted at 48 hours after discharge in all cases. The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% (Westmead Hospital) and 14.7% (New Children's Hospital) of admissions, with 56% medical in nature, 30% surgical, and the remainder procedural or psychological. Admission patterns were similar, with asthma, gastroenteritis, convulsion, pneumonia, and simple surgical conditions accounting for most short stay ward admissions. The short stay ward increased hospital efficiency with an average length of stay of 17.5 hours (Westmead Hospital) compared to 20.5 hours (New Children's Hospital). The users of the short stay ward were children of young age less than 2 years, with stay greater than 23 hours reported in only 1% of all admissions to the short stay ward. The rate of patient admission to an in-hospital bed was low, (4% [Westmead Hospital] compared to 6% [New Children's Hospital]), with the number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of short stay ward discharge less than 1%. There were no adverse events reported at either short stay ward, with parental satisfaction high.

"The objective of the current study is to determine to what extent the reduction of Chile's traffic fatalities and injuries during 2000-2012 was related to the police traffic enforcement increment registered after the introduction of its 2005 traffic law reform. A unique dataset with assembled information from public institutions and analyses based on ordinary least square and robust random effects models was carried out. Dependent variables were traffic fatality and severe injury rates per population and vehicle fleet. Independent variables were: (1) presence of new national traffic law; (2) police officers per population; (3) number of traffic tickets per police officer; and (4) interaction effect of number of traffic tickets per police officer with traffic law reform. Oil prices, alcohol consumption, proportion of male population 15-24 years old, unemployment, road infrastructure investment, years' effects and regions' effects represented control variables. Empirical estimates from instrumental variables suggest that the enactment of the traffic law reform in interaction with number of traffic tickets per police officer is significantly associated with a decrease of 8% in traffic fatalities and 7% in severe injuries. Piecewise regression model results for the 2007-2012 period suggest that police traffic enforcement reduced traffic fatalities by 59% and severe injuries by 37%."

Independent variables were: (1) presence of new national traffic law; (2) police officers per population; (3) number of traffic tickets per police officer; and (4) interaction effect of number of traffic tickets per police officer with traffic law reform. Oil prices, alcohol consumption, proportion of male population 15-24 years old, unemployment, road infrastructure investment, years' effects and regions' effects represented control variables. Empirical estimates from instrumental variables suggest that the enactment of the traffic law reform in interaction with number of traffic tickets per police officer is significantly associated with a decrease of 8% in traffic fatalities and 7% in severe injuries. Piecewise regression model results for the 2007-2012 period suggest that police traffic enforcement reduced traffic fatalities by 59% and severe injuries by 37%."

Problem:
"Did Chile's traffic law reform push police enforcement?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

According to the context, the study aimed to determine the relationship between Chile's traffic law reform and police traffic enforcement. The key findings related to this question are:

- The enactment of the traffic law reform, in interaction with the number of traffic tickets per police officer, is significantly associated with a decrease of:
  - 8% in traffic fatalities.
  - 7% in severe injuries.

Additionally, a piecewise regression model for the 2007-2012 period found that:

- Police traffic enforcement reduced traffic fatalities by 59%.

"The objective of the current study is to determine to what extent the reduction of Chile's traffic fatalities and injuries during 2000-2012 was related to the police traffic enforcement increment registered after the introduction of its 2005 traffic law reform. A unique dataset with assembled information from public institutions and analyses based on ordinary least square and robust random effects models was carried out. Dependent variables were traffic fatality and severe injury rates per population and vehicle fleet. Independent variables were: (1) presence of new national traffic law; (2) police officers per population; (3) number of traffic tickets per police officer; and (4) interaction effect of number of traffic tickets per police officer with traffic law reform.

Here is the given context:
"Trauma patients who require therapeutic anticoagulation pose a difficult treatment problem. The purpose of this study was to determine: (1) the incidence of complications using therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients, and (2) if any patient factors are associated with these complications. An 18-month retrospective review was performed on trauma patients>or= 15 years old who received therapeutic anticoagulation using unfractionated heparin (UH) and/or fractionated heparin (FH). Forty different pre-treatment and treatment patient characteristics were recorded. Complications of anticoagulation were documented and defined as any unanticipated discontinuation of the anticoagulant for bleeding or other adverse events. One-hundred-fourteen trauma patients were initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation. The most common indication for anticoagulation was deep venous thrombosis (46%). Twenty-four patients (21%) had at least 1 anticoagulation complication. The most common complication was a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring blood transfusion (11 patients). Five patients died (4%), 3 of whom had significant hemorrhage attributed to anticoagulation. Bivariate followed by logistic regression analysis identified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 9.2, 95%CI = 1.5-54.7), UH use (OR = 3.8, 95%CI = 1.1-13.0), and lower initial platelet count (OR = 1.004, 95%CI = 1.000-1.008) as being associated with complications.

The study examines the safety of therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients. Key findings include:

- Among 114 trauma patients initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation, 21% experienced at least one complication.
- Common complications included a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring blood transfusion.
- Five patients died, three due to significant hemorrhage attributed to anticoagulation.
- Factors associated with complications through bivariate and logistic regression analysis were:
  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 9.2, 95% CI = 1.5-54.7)
  - Unfractionated heparin (UH) use (OR = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.1-13.0)
  - Lower initial platelet count (OR = 1.004, 95% CI = 1.000-1.008)

The study examines the safety of therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients and identifies certain risk factors. Key points include:

1. **Incidence of Complications**: Out of 114 trauma patients who received anticoagulation, 24 (21%) experienced at least one complication.
   
2. **Common Complications**: The most frequent complication was a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring a blood transfusion, affecting 11 patients. Additionally, five patients died, three of whom had significant hemorrhage attributed to anticoagulation.

3. **Risk Factors Identified**:
   - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): Patients with COPD had a significantly higher risk (OR = 9.2, 95% CI = 1.5-54.7).
   - Unfractionated heparin (UH) use: Patients receiving UH were more likely to experience complications compared to those receiving fractionated heparin (FH) (OR = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.1-13.0).
   - Lower initial platelet count: A slightly increased risk was noted with each unit decrease in initial platelet count (OR = 1.004, 95% CI = 1.000-1.008).

4. **Anticoagulant Types**: There were differences between patients receiving UH versus FH, including variations in laboratory values and anticoagulation indications.

In summary, while therapeutic anticoagulation can be necessary for trauma patients, it carries risks, particularly in those with COPD, those receiving UH, and those with lower initial platelet counts. The overall safety profile appears to be less favorable when using UH compared to FH."

Based on the provided information, therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients does carry a risk of complications, and certain patient factors increase this risk. Therefore, the safety of therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients is questionable without careful consideration of individual patient characteristics.

Here is the given context:
"Trauma patients who require therapeutic anticoagulation pose a difficult treatment problem. The purpose of this study was to determine: (1) the incidence of complications using therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients, and (2) if any patient factors are associated with these complications. An 18-month retrospective review was performed on trauma patients>or= 15 years old who received therapeutic anticoagulation using unfractionated heparin (UH) and/or fractionated heparin (FH). Forty different pre-treatment and treatment patient characteristics were recorded. Complications of anticoagulation were documented and defined as any unanticipated discontinuation of the anticoagulant for bleeding or other adverse events. One-hundred-fourteen trauma patients were initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation. The most common indication for anticoagulation was deep venous thrombosis (46%). Twenty-four patients (21%) had at least 1 anticoagulation complication. The most common complication was a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring blood transfusion (11 patients). Five patients died (4%), 3 of whom had significant hemorrhage attributed to anticoagulation. Bivariate followed by logistic regression analysis identified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 9.2, 95%CI = 1.5-54.7), UH use (OR = 3.8, 95%CI = 1.1-13.0), and lower initial platelet count (OR = 1.004, 95%CI = 1.000-1.008) as being associated with complications. Patients receiving UH vs. FH differed in several characteristics including laboratory values and anticoagulation indications."

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.
assistant
The study examines the safety of therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients, specifically focusing on the incidence of complications and identifying patient factors associated with these complications. Key findings include:

1. **Incidence of Complications**: Out of 114 trauma patients who received therapeutic anticoagulation, 24 (21%) experienced at least one complication. The most frequent complication was a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring blood transfusion (11 patients).

2. **Mortality**: Five patients (4%) died, with three deaths attributed to significant hemorrhage related to anticoagulation.

3. **Risk Factors Identified**:
   - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 9.2, 95% CI = 1.5-54.7)
   - Use of unfractionated heparin (OR = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.1-13.0)
   - Lower initial platelet count (OR = 1.004, 95% CI = 1.000-1.008)

The objective of this study was to determine whether automated, at-the-visit tailored prompts about family history risk change PCP behavior. Automated, tailored prompts highlighting familial risk for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and breast, colorectal, or ovarian cancer were implemented during 2011 to 2012.

The study aimed to determine if automated, at-the-visit tailored prompts about family history risk would change primary care provider (PCP) behavior. These prompts highlighted familial risk for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. The research involved 492 eligible patients aged 35 to 65 years with a moderate or strong familial risk for one of six diseases, over 847 visits during 2011 to 2012. 

Key findings include:
- 152 visits (18%) had no documentation of a response to a family history prompt.
- Of the remaining 695 visits, 53.5% of visits saw the PCP review family history, 22.9% discussed it, 22.3% did not address it, and only 0.7% resulted in both a review of family history and ordering of tests or referrals.
- There was no significant change in the documentation of risk status in problem summary lists or in the implementation of screening interventions for any of the six diseases.

Medical records of a cohort of community-based primary care patients, aged 35 to 65 years, who previously participated in our Family Healthware study and had a moderate or strong familial risk for any of the 6 diseases were subsequently reviewed. The main outcome measures were PCP response to the prompts, adding family history risk to problem summary lists, and patient screening status for each disease. The 492 eligible patients had 847 visits during the study period; 152 visits had no documentation of response to a family history prompt. Of the remaining 695 visits, physician responses were reviewed family history (n = 372, 53.5%), discussed family history (n = 159, 22.9%), not addressed (n = 155, 22.3%), and reviewed family history and ordered tests/referrals (n = 5, 0.7%). There was no significant change in problem summary list documentation of risk status or screening interventions for any of the 6 diseases."

"Prompting Primary Care Providers about Increased Patient Risk As a Result of Family History: Does It Work?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.
assistant
The study aimed to assess whether automated, at-the-visit tailored prompts about family history risk could influence primary care provider (PCP) behavior. These prompts highlighted familial risks for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain cancers (breast, colorectal, or ovarian). The prompts were implemented during 2011 to 2012 for a cohort of community-based primary care patients aged 35 to 65 years who had a moderate or strong familial risk for any of the six diseases.

During the study period, 847 visits were recorded for 492 eligible patients. The responses to the prompts varied: 
- 53.5% of visits involved reviewing family history.
- 22.9% involved discussing family history.
- 22.3% did not address family history.
- Only 0.7% involved both reviewing family history and ordering tests or referrals.

Despite these responses, there was no significant change in the documentation of risk status in problem summary lists or in the implementation of screening interventions for any of the six diseases."

Here is the given context:
"Recent years have seen a rapid proliferation of emergency ultrasound (EUS) programs in the United States. To date, there is no evidence supporting that EUS fellowships enhance residents' ultrasound (US) educational experiences. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of EUS fellowships on emergency medicine (EM) residents' US education. We conducted a cross-sectional study at 9 academic medical centers. A questionnaire on US education and bedside US use was pilot tested and given to EM residents. The primary outcomes included the number of US examinations performed, scope of bedside US applications, barriers to residents' US education, and US use in the emergency department. The secondary outcomes were factors that would impact residents' US education. The outcomes were compared between residency programs with and without EUS fellowships. A total of 244 EM residents participated in this study. Thirty percent (95% confidence interval, 24%-35%) reported they had performed more than 150 scans. Residents in programs with EUS fellowships reported performing more scans than those in programs without fellowships (P = .04). Significant differences were noted in most applications of bedside US between residency programs with and without fellowships (P<.05). There were also significant differences in the barriers to US education between residency programs with and without fellowships (P<.05)."

The context indicates that emergency ultrasound (EUS) fellowship programs do impact emergency medicine (EM) residents' ultrasound education. Specifically:

1. **Number of Ultrasound Examinations**: Residents in programs with EUS fellowships reported performing more ultrasound scans than those in programs without fellowships (P = .04).

2. **Scope of Bedside Ultrasound Applications**: There were significant differences in the applications of bedside ultrasound between residency programs with and without EUS fellowships (P < .05).

3. **Barriers to Ultrasound Education**: There were also significant differences in the barriers to ultrasound education between residency programs with and without EUS fellowships (P < .05).

These findings suggest that EUS fellowships can positively influence the quantity and variety of ultrasound experiences for EM residents, as well as address some of the challenges faced in their ultrasound education."

You are supposed to summarize the key information from the given context to answer the provided question.

Here is the given context:
"To assess and compare the value of split-liver transplantation (SLT) and living-related liver transplantation (LRT). The concept of SLT results from the development of reduced-size transplantation. A further development of SLT, the in situ split technique, is derived from LRT, which itself marks the optimized outcome in terms of postoperative graft function and survival. The combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, thus raising the question whether living donor liver transplantation is still necessary. Outcomes and postoperative liver function of 43 primary LRT patients were compared with those of 49 primary SLT patients (14 ex situ, 35 in situ) with known graft weight performed between April 1996 and December 2000. Survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. After a median follow-up of 35 months, actual patient survival rates were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group. Actual graft survival rates were 76% and 81%, respectively. The incidence of primary nonfunction was 12% in the SLT group and 2.3% in the LRT group. Liver function parameters (prothrombin time, factor V, bilirubin clearance) and surgical complication rates did not differ significantly. In the SLT group, mean cold ischemic time was longer than in the LRT group. Serum values of alanine aminotransferase during the first postoperative week were significantly higher in the SLT group. In the LRT group, there were more grafts with signs of fatty degeneration than in the SLT group."

Problem:
"Is there still a need for living-related liver transplantation in children?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

The context provides information on a study comparing the outcomes of split-liver transplantation (SLT) and living-related liver transplantation (LRT) in patients. The key points related to the question "Is there still a need for living-related liver transplantation in children?" are:

- The actual patient survival rates after a median follow-up of 35 months were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group.
- The actual graft survival rates were 76% in the SLT group and 81% in the LRT group.
- The incidence of primary nonfunction was higher in the SLT group (12%) compared to the LRT group (2.3%).
- Liver function parameters and surgical complication rates did not differ significantly between the two groups.
- The study suggests that the combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, raising the question whether LRT is still necessary.

Considering these points, the study does not provide a clear answer to whether living-related liver transplantation is still necessary. However, it implies that the outcomes of SLT have improved to a point where it may be a viable alternative to LRT, potentially reducing the need for living donor liver transplantation."

Based on the provided information, while SLT has shown promising outcomes and reduced the need for some living donor transplants, the data do not definitively eliminate the need for LRT, especially considering the lower incidence of primary nonfunction in LRT. Therefore, the need for LRT might still exist depending on specific patient conditions and other factors.

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

The context provides information on a study comparing the outcomes of split-liver transplantation (SLT) and living-related liver transplantation (LRT) in patients. The key points related to the question "Is there still a need for living-related liver transplantation in children?" are:

- The actual patient survival rates after a median follow-up of 35 months were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group.
- The actual graft survival rates were 76% in the SLT group and 81% in the LRT group.
- The incidence of primary nonfunction was higher in the SLT group (12%) compared to the LRT group (2.3%).
- Liver function parameters and surgical complication rates did not differ significantly between the two groups.
- The study suggests that the combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, raising the question whether LRT is still necessary.

Considering these points, the study does not provide a clear answer to whether living-related liver transplantation is still necessary.

Based on the provided information, while SLT has shown promising outcomes, the higher incidence of primary nonfunction in the SLT group compared to the LRT group suggests that LRT might still offer certain advantages. Therefore, the need for LRT in specific cases, particularly in children, cannot be entirely ruled out without further evidence.

The study indicates that split-liver transplantation (SLT) has achieved comparable survival rates to living-related liver transplantation (LRT), but LRT still offers a lower incidence of primary nonfunction. Given the advancements in SLT, the need for LRT might be reduced, but the decision would depend on specific clinical scenarios and patient needs.

Given the similar survival rates and comparable outcomes between SLT and LRT, along with the lower incidence of primary nonfunction in LRT, the need for living-related liver transplantation (LRT) may still exist due to its unique advantages such as avoiding cold ischemic time and potential long-term benefits. However, the decision should consider individual patient circumstances and transplant center expertise.

Given the similar outcomes between SLT and LRT, with LRT showing a lower incidence of primary nonfunction, the decision to continue living-related liver transplantation in children would depend on specific clinical scenarios and patient needs. However, the current data suggest that SLT can effectively address many needs, potentially reducing the reliance on LRT.

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

According to the given context, patterns of knowledge and attitudes do exist among unvaccinated seniors. The seniors were clustered into four groups based on their immunization-related knowledge and attitudes:

1.  **Potentials** (45%): They would receive the influenza vaccine to prevent disease.
2.  **Fearful Uninformeds** (9%): They were unsure if the influenza vaccine causes illness.
3.  **Doubters** (27%): They were unsure if the vaccine is efficacious.
4.  **Misinformeds** (19%): They believed the influenza vaccine causes illness.

These clusters show that there are distinct patterns of knowledge and attitudes among unvaccinated seniors, indicating that the answer to the problem is yes, patterns of knowledge and attitudes do exist among unvaccinated seniors."

You are supposed to summarize the key information from the given context to answer the provided question.

Here is the given context:
"To examine patterns of knowledge and attitudes among adults aged>65 years unvaccinated for influenza. Surveyed Medicare beneficiaries in 5 areas; clustered unvaccinated seniors by their immunization related knowledge and attitudes. Identified 4 clusters: Potentials (45%) would receive influenza vaccine to prevent disease; Fearful Uninformeds (9%) were unsure if influenza vaccine causes illness; Doubters (27%) were unsure if vaccine is efficacious; Misinformeds (19%) believed influenza vaccine causes illness. More Potentials (75%) and Misinformeds (70%) ever received influenza vaccine than did Fearful Uninformeds (18%) and Doubters (29%)."

Problem:
"Do patterns of knowledge and attitudes exist among unvaccinated seniors?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

According to the given context, patterns of knowledge and attitudes do exist among unvaccinated seniors. The seniors were clustered into four groups based on their immunization-related knowledge and attitudes:

1.  **Potentials** (45%): They would receive the influenza vaccine to prevent disease.
2.  **Fearful Uninformeds** (9%): They were unsure if the influenza vaccine causes illness.
3.  **Doubters** (27%): They were unsure if the vaccine is efficacious.
4.  **Misinformeds** (19%): They believed the influenza vaccine causes illness.

These clusters show that there are distinct patterns of knowledge and attitudes among unvaccinated seniors, indicating that the answer to the problem is yes, patterns of knowledge and attitudes do exist among unvaccinated seniors."

Please provide yes, no or maybe to the given problem. Always conclude the last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $VALUE' (without quotes) where VALUE is either 'yes' or 'no' or 'maybe'.

"Elevated resting heart rate (RHR) is a neglected marker in cardiovascular risk factor studies of sub-Saharan African populations. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of elevated RHR and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to investigate any associations between RHR and these risk factors in a rural population in Ghana. Cross-sectional analysis. A total of 574 adults aged between 18-65 years were randomly sampled from a population register. Data collected included those on sociodemographic variables and anthropometric, blood pressure (BP), and RHR measurements. Within-person variability in RHR was calculated using data from repeat measurements taken 2 weeks apart. Of study participants, 36% were male. Prevalence of casual high BP was 19%. In the population, 10% were current cigarette smokers and habitual alcohol use was high at 56%. As measured by body mass index, 2% were obese and 14% had abdominal obesity. RHR was elevated (>90 bpm) in 19%. Overall, 79% of study participants were found to have at least one CVD risk factor. RHR was significantly associated with age, waist circumference, and BP. Individuals with an elevated RHR had a higher risk (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.15-3.26%, p = 0.013) of casual high BP compared with participants with normal RHR independently of several established CVD risk factors.

"Elevated resting heart rate (RHR) is a neglected marker in cardiovascular risk factor studies of sub-Saharan African populations. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of elevated RHR and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to investigate any associations between RHR and these risk factors in a rural population in Ghana. Cross-sectional analysis. A total of 574 adults aged between 18-65 years were randomly sampled from a population register. Data collected included those on sociodemographic variables and anthropometric, blood pressure (BP), and RHR measurements. Within-person variability in RHR was calculated using data from repeat measurements taken 2 weeks apart. Of study participants, 36% were male. Prevalence of casual high BP was 19%. In the population, 10% were current cigarette smokers and habitual alcohol use was high at 56%. As measured by body mass index, 2% were obese and 14% had abdominal obesity. RHR was elevated (>90 bpm) in 19%. Overall, 79% of study participants were found to have at least one CVD risk factor. RHR was significantly associated with age, waist circumference, and BP. Individuals with an elevated RHR had a higher risk (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.15-3.26%, p = 0.013) of casual high BP compared with participants with normal RHR independently of several established CVD risk factors. The regression dilution ratio of RHR was 0.75 (95% CI 0.62-0.89)."

"Secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) threatens fragile infants discharged from a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Smoking practices were examined in families with a high respiratory risk infant (born at very low birth weight; ventilated>12 hr) in a Houston, Texas, NICU. Socioeconomic status, race, and mental health status were hypothesized to be related to SHSe and household smoking bans. Data were collected as part of The Baby's Breath Project, a hospital-based SHSe intervention trial targeting parents with a high-risk infant in the NICU who reported a smoker in the household (N = 99). Measures of sociodemographics, smoking, home and car smoking bans, and depression were collected. Overall, 26% of all families with a high-risk infant in the NICU reported a household smoker. Almost half of the families with a smoker reported an annual income of less than $25,000. 46.2% of families reported having a total smoking ban in place in both their homes and cars. Only 27.8% families earning less than $25,000 reported having a total smoking ban in place relative to almost 60% of families earning more (p<.01).

- There is also a disparity in household smoking bans based on ethnicity, with African American and Caucasian families less likely to have a smoking ban compared to Hispanic families (p<.05).
- Mothers who reported no smoking ban were more depressed than those who had a household smoking ban (p<.02).

This information suggests that there is a potential for significant health disparities related to secondhand smoke risk in infants discharged from an NICU, particularly among low-income and minority families."

Here is the given context:
"Secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) threatens fragile infants discharged from a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Smoking practices were examined in families with a high respiratory risk infant (born at very low birth weight; ventilated>12 hr) in a Houston, Texas, NICU. Socioeconomic status, race, and mental health status were hypothesized to be related to SHSe and household smoking bans. Data were collected as part of The Baby's Breath Project, a hospital-based SHSe intervention trial targeting parents with a high-risk infant in the NICU who reported a smoker in the household (N = 99). Measures of sociodemographics, smoking, home and car smoking bans, and depression were collected. Overall, 26% of all families with a high-risk infant in the NICU reported a household smoker. Almost half of the families with a smoker reported an annual income of less than $25,000. 46.2% of families reported having a total smoking ban in place in both their homes and cars. Only 27.8% families earning less than $25,000 reported having a total smoking ban in place relative to almost 60% of families earning more (p<.01). African American and Caucasian families were less likely to have a smoking ban compared with Hispanics (p<.05).

The study indicates that mechanical factors such as teeth grinding and facial trauma are associated with both chronic oro-facial pain and the reporting of other unexplained syndromes, which can be indicative of somatisation. Therefore, there is a suggestion that reports of mechanical dysfunction in chronic oro-facial pain might be related to somatisation.

The Hawkins sign was evaluated for its ability to predict the development of avascular necrosis in fractures of the neck of the astragalus. In a retrospective study involving 23 talar neck fractures over a period of thirteen years, the presence of the Hawkins sign was analyzed alongside other factors such as fracture displacement, soft tissue injury, delay in treatment, and type of treatment. 

Key findings include:
- Out of 23 cases, the Hawkins sign was observed in 12 cases, none of which developed necrosis.
- Four cases without a positive Hawkins sign did develop necrosis.
- No statistically significant differences were found regarding necrosis based on fracture displacement, soft tissue injury, or delay in treatment.
- A statistically significant difference was found between the development of avascular necrosis and the presence of the Hawkins sign (P=.03).

It is also assessed whether the occurrence of this complication is related to the displacement of the fracture, soft tissue injury, or delay in the reduction or surgery. The results were compared with those found in the literature. A retrospective study was conducted on 23 talar neck fractures recorded over a a period of thirteen years. The following variables were analysed: displacement of the fracture, soft tissue injury, delay and type of treatment, complications, observation of the Hawkins sign, and functional outcome. There were 7 type I Hawkins fractures, 11 type II, and 4 type III and 1 type IV. Four cases developed avascular necrosis (2 Hawkins type II and 2 type III). Hawkins sign was observed in 12 cases, of which none developed necrosis. Four cases with negative Hawkins sign developed necrosis. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the development of avascular necrosis with the displacement of the fracture, soft tissue injury, or delay in treatment. Differences were found when comparing the development of avascular necrosis with the Hawkins sign (P=.03)."

Problem:
"Is the Hawkins sign able to predict necrosis in fractures of the neck of the astragalus?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.
assistant
The Hawkins sign was evaluated to determine its predictive value for avascular necrosis in fractures of the neck of the astragalus. In a retrospective study of 23 talar neck fractures over a 13-year period, the following observations were made:

- Out of 23 cases, 7 had a type I Hawkins sign, 11 had a type II, and 4 had types III and IV.
- Four cases developed avascular necrosis: 2 with type II Hawkins sign and 2 with type III.
- Twelve cases showed the Hawkins sign, but none of these developed necrosis.
- Four cases without a positive Hawkins sign did develop necrosis.
- No statistically significant differences were found regarding the development of avascular necrosis based on fracture displacement, soft tissue injury, or delay in treatment.
- However, there was a statistically significant difference in the development of avascular necrosis when comparing the presence of the Hawkins sign (P=.03).

Based on these findings, the Hawkins sign appears to have some predictive value for avascular necrosis in fractures of the neck of the astragalus, though further research would be needed to confirm this relationship."

Please provide yes, no or maybe to the given problem. Always conclude the last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $VALUE' (without quotes) where VALUE is either 'yes' or 'no' or 'maybe'.
assistant
Based on the statistical significance found in the study, the Hawkins sign does show potential as a predictor for avascular necrosis in fractures of the neck of the astragalus.

Here is the given context:
"To investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions.STUDY DESIGN/ A total of 123 dysphonic individuals with benign vocal pathologies were recruited. They were given either genuine acupuncture (n = 40), sham acupuncture (n = 44), or no treatment (n = 39) for 6 weeks (two 30-minute sessions/wk). The genuine acupuncture group received needles puncturing nine voice-related acupoints for 30 minutes, two times a week for 6 weeks, whereas the sham acupuncture group received blunted needles stimulating the skin surface of the nine acupoints for the same frequency and duration. The no-treatment group did not receive any intervention but attended just the assessment sessions. One-hundred seventeen subjects completed the study (genuine acupuncture = 40; sham acupuncture = 43; and no treatment = 34), but only 84 of them had a complete set of vocal functions and quality of life measures (genuine acupuncture = 29; sham acupuncture = 33; and no-treatment = 22) and 42 of them with a complete set of endoscopic data (genuine acupuncture = 16; sham acupuncture = 15; and no treatment = 11). Significant improvement in vocal function, as indicated by the maximum fundamental frequency produced, and also perceived quality of life, were found in both the genuine and sham acupuncture groups, but not in the no-treatment group. Structural (morphological) improvements were, however, only noticed in the genuine acupuncture group, which demonstrated a significant reduction in the size of the vocal fold lesions."

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

To answer the question "Is Acupuncture Efficacious for Treating Phonotraumatic Vocal Pathologies?", the relevant information from the context is as follows:

- 123 individuals with dysphonic issues due to benign vocal pathologies were recruited for the study.
- They were divided into three groups: genuine acupuncture (n = 40), sham acupuncture (n = 44), and no treatment (n = 39).
- The genuine acupuncture group showed significant improvements in both vocal function (maximum fundamental frequency produced) and perceived quality of life.
- The sham acupuncture group also showed significant improvements in vocal function and quality of life, but not to the same extent as the genuine acupuncture group.
- The no-treatment group showed no significant improvements in vocal function or quality of life.
- The genuine acupuncture group demonstrated significant structural improvements, specifically a reduction in the size of the vocal fold lesions.

Based on this information, the study suggests that acupuncture, both genuine and sham, may be efficacious in treating phonotraumatic vocal pathologies, but the genuine acupuncture group showed more significant improvements, especially in structural aspects."

Here is the given context:
"Recent evaluations of IT innovations in primary care have highlighted variations between centres and practices in uptake and use. We evaluated whether structural characteristics of a general practice were associated with variations in use of a web-based clinical information system underpinning a Managed Clinical Network in diabetes, between the years 2001 and 2003. Using a computerised audit trail, we calculated the numbers of web-based operations that occurred in each practice, stratified by staff type and year, and adjusted for the numbers of registered diabetic patients. In regression analyses, we determined whether total use was associated with structural characteristics of the practice (total list size, training status, numbers of GPs (general practitioners), mean age of the GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population and whether staff had received advanced training in diabetes care). Initially there were a few practices which made very frequent use of the information system, with relatively high numbers of practices using the facility infrequently. However, overall use gradually became more evenly spread. This effect was particularly evident among nurse users. Frequent use by GPs was evident in only a small number of practices, with mean GP use decreasing over the three years. In linear regression analyses, none of the general practice variables were associated with online use, either overall or stratified by staff type, except for the numbers of diabetes-educated staff. This was consistently associated with increased use by nurses and GPs."

According to the context, the study evaluated the association between structural characteristics of general practices and the use of a web-based clinical information system in diabetes care. The key findings are:

- Initially, there were significant variations in the use of the information system, with some practices using it frequently and others infrequently.
- However, overall use became more evenly spread over time.
- Frequent use by GPs was observed in only a small number of practices, with a decrease in mean GP use over the three years.
- In linear regression analyses, none of the general practice variables (such as total list size, training status, numbers of GPs, mean age of GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population) were associated with online use, except for the numbers of diabetes-educated staff.
- The number of diabetes-educated staff was consistently associated with increased use of the information system by both nurses and GPs.

"Recent evaluations of IT innovations in primary care have highlighted variations between centres and practices in uptake and use. We evaluated whether structural characteristics of a general practice were associated with variations in use of a web-based clinical information system underpinning a Managed Clinical Network in diabetes, between the years 2001 and 2003. Using a computerised audit trail, we calculated the numbers of web-based operations that occurred in each practice, stratified by staff type and year, and adjusted for the numbers of registered diabetic patients. In regression analyses, we determined whether total use was associated with structural characteristics of the practice (total list size, training status, numbers of GPs (general practitioners), mean age of the GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population and whether staff had received advanced training in diabetes care). Initially there were a few practices which made very frequent use of the information system, with relatively high numbers of practices using the facility infrequently. However, overall use gradually became more evenly spread. This effect was particularly evident among nurse users. Frequent use by GPs was evident in only a small number of practices, with mean GP use decreasing over the three years. In linear regression analyses, none of the general practice variables were associated with online use, either overall or stratified by staff type, except for the numbers of diabetes-educated staff. This was consistently associated with increased use by nurses and GPs."

Problem:
"Do general practice characteristics influence uptake of an information technology (IT) innovation in primary care?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

The key information from the context related to the question is as follows:

- There were variations in the use of a web-based clinical information system among general practices, with some practices using it frequently and others infrequently.
- The use of the system became more evenly spread over the three years, particularly among nurse users.
- Frequent use by GPs was observed in only a small number of practices, with a decrease in mean GP use over the three years.
- In linear regression analyses, none of the general practice variables (such as total list size, training status, numbers of GPs, mean age of GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population) were associated with online use, except for one variable.
- The exception was the number of diabetes-educated staff, which was consistently associated with increased use by both nurses and GPs.

This information suggests that the characteristics of the general practice itself do not seem to have a significant impact on the uptake of the IT innovation, except for the number of diabetes-educated staff, which is positively associated with increased use."

"To compare adherence to follow-up recommendations for colposcopy or repeated Papanicolaou (Pap) smears for women with previously abnormal Pap smear results. Retrospective cohort study. Three northern California family planning clinics. All women with abnormal Pap smear results referred for initial colposcopy and a random sample of those referred for repeated Pap smear. Medical records were located and reviewed for 90 of 107 women referred for colposcopy and 153 of 225 women referred for repeated Pap smears. Routine clinic protocols for follow-up--telephone call, letter, or certified letter--were applied without regard to the type of abnormality seen on a Pap smear or recommended examination. Documented adherence to follow-up within 8 months of an abnormal result. Attempts to contact the patients for follow-up, adherence to follow-up recommendations, and patient characteristics were abstracted from medical records. The probability of adherence to follow-up vs the number of follow-up attempts was modeled with survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine multivariate relationships related to adherence. The rate of overall adherence to follow-up recommendations was 56.0% (136/243). Adherence to a second colposcopy was not significantly different from that to a repeated Pap smear (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-2.46). The use of as many as 3 patient reminders substantially improved adherence to follow-up. Women without insurance and women attending 1 of the 3 clinics were less likely to adhere to any follow-up recommendation (hazard ratio for no insurance, 0.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.93], and for clinic, 0.35 [95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.73])."

Problem:
"Do follow-up recommendations for abnormal Papanicolaou smears influence patient adherence?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

The study investigated the adherence to follow-up recommendations for women with abnormal Pap smear results. The key findings related to the question are:

- The overall rate of adherence to follow-up recommendations was 56.0% (136/243).
- Adherence to a second colposcopy was not significantly different from that to a repeated Pap smear (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-2.46).
- The use of as many as 3 patient reminders substantially improved adherence to follow-up.
- Women without insurance and women attending 1 of the 3 clinics were less likely to adhere to any follow-up recommendation.

These findings suggest that the type of follow-up recommendation (colposcopy or repeated Pap smear) does not significantly influence patient adherence, but rather other factors such as the number of reminders and patient characteristics (insurance status and clinic) play a more significant role in adherence to follow-up recommendations."

The study indicates that the type of follow-up recommendation (colposcopy or repeated Pap smear) does not significantly influence patient adherence, but rather the number of reminders and patient characteristics such as insurance status and clinic attendance do. Therefore, follow-up recommendations alone may not be the primary factor influencing patient adherence.

"To compare adherence to follow-up recommendations for colposcopy or repeated Papanicolaou (Pap) smears for women with previously abnormal Pap smear results. Retrospective cohort study. Three northern California family planning clinics. All women with abnormal Pap smear results referred for initial colposcopy and a random sample of those referred for repeated Pap smear. Medical records were located and reviewed for 90 of 107 women referred for colposcopy and 153 of 225 women referred for repeated Pap smears. Routine clinic protocols for follow-up--telephone call, letter, or certified letter--were applied without regard to the type of abnormality seen on a Pap smear or recommended examination. Documented adherence to follow-up within 8 months of an abnormal result. Attempts to contact the patients for follow-up, adherence to follow-up recommendations, and patient characteristics were abstracted from medical records. The probability of adherence to follow-up vs the number of follow-up attempts was modeled with survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine multivariate relationships related to adherence. The rate of overall adherence to follow-up recommendations was 56.0% (136/243).

"Compared with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) may have additional value in the assessment of primary and recurrent cervical cancer. However, the degree of tumour uptake of (18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -glucose (FDG) uptake is sometimes influenced by diabetes mellitus (DM). Therefore, we conducted this prospective study to compare the diagnostic ability of FDG-PET in patients with cervical cancer complicated by DM and those without DM. Patients with untreated locally advanced primary or clinically curable recurrent cervical carcinoma were enrolled. Both FDG-PET and MRI/CT scans were performed within 2 weeks. Patients were categorised into the following groups: hyperglycaemic DM (fasting blood sugar>126 mg/dl), euglycaemic DM and non-DM. The lesions were confirmed histologically or by clinical follow-up. The receiver operating characteristic curve method, with calculation of the area under the curve (AUC), was used to evaluate the discriminative power. From February 2001 to January 2003, 219 patients (75 with primary and 144 with recurrent cervical cancer) were eligible for analysis. Sixteen had hyperglycaemic DM, 12 had euglycaemic DM and 191 were in the non-DM group. The diagnostic power of PET in the hyperglycaemic DM, euglycaemic DM and non-DM groups did not differ significantly with regard to the identification of either metastatic lesions (AUC, 0.967/0.947/0.925, P>0.05) or primary tumours/local recurrence (AUC, 0.950/0.938/0.979, P>0.05).

"Does diabetes mellitus influence the efficacy of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of cervical cancer?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

The study investigated the effect of diabetes mellitus (DM) on the efficacy of FDG-PET in diagnosing cervical cancer. The key findings are:

- The study included 219 patients with cervical cancer, categorized into three groups: hyperglycaemic DM, euglycaemic DM, and non-DM.
- The diagnostic power of PET was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve method, with calculation of the area under the curve (AUC).
- The results showed that the diagnostic power of PET did not differ significantly among the three groups (hyperglycaemic DM, euglycaemic DM, and non-DM) in identifying metastatic lesions (AUC: 0.967/0.947/0.925, P>0.05) or primary tumours/local recurrence (AUC: 0.950/0.938/0.979, P>0.05).
- However, when considering all DM patients, PET showed a significantly higher detection power than MRI/CT scans in identifying metastatic lesions (AUC=0.956 vs 0.824, P=0.012).

Based on these findings, the study suggests that diabetes mellitus does not significantly influence the efficacy of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of cervical cancer."

"Telephone counseling and tailored print communications have emerged as promising methods for promoting mammography screening. However, there has been little research testing, within the same randomized field trial, of the efficacy of these two methods compared to a high-quality usual care system for enhancing screening. This study addressed the question: Compared to usual care, is tailored telephone counseling more effective than tailored print materials for promoting mammography screening? Three-year randomized field trial. One thousand ninety-nine women aged 50 and older recruited from a health maintenance organization in North Carolina. Women were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: (1) usual care, (2) tailored print communications, and (3) tailored telephone counseling. Adherence to mammography screening based on self-reports obtained during 1995, 1996, and 1997. Compared to usual care alone, telephone counseling promoted a significantly higher proportion of women having mammograms on schedule (71% vs 61%) than did tailored print (67% vs 61%) but only after the first year of intervention (during 1996). Furthermore, compared to usual care, telephone counseling was more effective than tailored print materials at promoting being on schedule with screening during 1996 and 1997 among women who were off-schedule during the previous year."

The study investigated whether tailored interventions could increase mammography use among women aged 50 and older from a health maintenance organization (HMO) in North Carolina. Specifically, it compared the effectiveness of tailored telephone counseling and tailored print communications against usual care. The key findings are:

1. **Tailored Telephone Counseling vs. Usual Care**: Women receiving tailored telephone counseling had a significantly higher adherence rate to mammography screening compared to those receiving usual care (71% vs. 61%).

2. **Tailored Print Materials vs. Usual Care**: Women receiving tailored print materials also showed increased adherence to mammography screening compared to those receiving usual care (67% vs. 61%), but this effect was less pronounced and only significant after the first year of the intervention.

3. **Comparison Between Tailored Interventions**: Tailored telephone counseling was more effective than tailored print materials at promoting timely mammography screening among women who were previously off-schedule. This difference was observed during both 1996 and 1997.

In summary, tailored interventions, particularly telephone counseling, can increase mammography use among HMO women, with telephone counseling showing a more pronounced and sustained effect compared to tailored print materials."

Here is the given context:
"From March 2007 to January 2011, 88 DBE procedures were performed on 66 patients. Indications included evaluation anemia/gastrointestinal bleed, small bowel IBD and dilation of strictures. Video-capsule endoscopy (VCE) was used prior to DBE in 43 of the 66 patients prior to DBE evaluation. The mean age was 62 years. Thirty-two patients were female, 15 were African-American; 44 antegrade and 44 retrograde DBEs were performed. The mean time per antegrade DBE was 107.4±30.0 minutes with a distance of 318.4±152.9 cm reached past the pylorus. The mean time per lower DBE was 100.7±27.3 minutes with 168.9±109.1 cm meters past the ileocecal valve reached. Endoscopic therapy in the form of electrocautery to ablate bleeding sources was performed in 20 patients (30.3%), biopsy in 17 patients (25.8%) and dilation of Crohn's-related small bowel strictures in 4 (6.1%). 43 VCEs with pathology noted were performed prior to DBE, with findings endoscopically confirmed in 32 cases (74.4%). In 3 cases the DBE showed findings not noted on VCE."

"Double balloon enteroscopy: is it efficacious and safe in a community setting?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

To answer the question of whether double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) is efficacious and safe in a community setting, the relevant information from the context can be summarized as follows:

**Efficacy:**

- DBE was used to evaluate anemia/gastrointestinal bleed, small bowel IBD, and dilation of strictures in 66 patients.
- Endoscopic therapy (electrocautery, biopsy, and stricture dilation) was performed in 41 patients (61.4% of the total).
- Pathology findings from video-capsule endoscopy (VCE) were confirmed in 74.4% of the cases.

**Safety:**

- The procedure was performed on 88 patients over a period of 4 years, indicating a manageable workload in a community setting.
- The mean time per antegrade DBE was 107.4 minutes, and the mean time per retrograde DBE was 100.7 minutes, suggesting a feasible procedure time.
- The distance reached past the pylorus (318.4 cm) and past the ileocecal valve (168.9 cm) indicates the ability to effectively access the small bowel.

Overall, the data suggests that DBE is a viable option for evaluating and treating small bowel disorders in a community setting, with a good balance between efficacy and safety."

Please provide yes, no or maybe to the given problem. Always conclude the last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $VALUE' (without quotes) where VALUE is either 'yes' or 'no' or'maybe'.assistant

Based on the provided information, DBE appears to be a safe and efficacious procedure in a community setting. The procedure was performed on a manageable number of patients over a period of 4 years, and the mean procedure times were reasonable. The ability to effectively access the small bowel and the high rate of confirmed pathology findings from VCE suggest that DBE can be an effective tool for evaluating and treating small bowel disorders in a community setting.

You are supposed to summarize the key information from the given context to answer the provided question.

Here is the given context:
"Although observational data support an inverse relationship between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and coronary heart disease (CHD), genetic HDL deficiency states often do not correlate with premature CHD. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) measurements were obtained in cases comprising 10 different mutations in LCAT, ABCA1 and APOA1 to further evaluate the relationship between low HDL resulting from genetic variation and early atherosclerosis. In a 1:2 case-control study of sex and age-related (+/-5 y) subjects (n=114), cIMT was nearly identical between cases (0.66+/-0.17 cm) and controls (0.65+/-0.18 cm) despite significantly lower HDL cholesterol (0.67 vs. 1.58 mmol/l) and apolipoprotein A-I levels (96.7 vs. 151.4 mg/dl) (P<0.05)"

Problem:
"Do mutations causing low HDL-C promote increased carotid intima-media thickness?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.
assistant
The context provides information on a study that investigated whether mutations causing low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) promote increased carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), an indicator of early atherosclerosis. The study involved 114 participants who had 10 different mutations in genes associated with low HDL, including LCAT, ABCA1, and APOA1. Despite having significantly lower HDL cholesterol levels (0.67 mmol/L) and apolipoprotein A-I levels (96.7 mg/dL) compared to controls (1.58 mmol/L and 151.4 mg/dL respectively), the cIMT measurements were similar between cases (0.66 ± 0.17 cm) and controls (0.65 ± 0.18 cm). This suggests that mutations leading to low HDL-C do not necessarily promote increased carotid intima-media thickness in this context."

Please provide yes, no or maybe to the given problem. Always conclude the last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $VALUE' (without quotes) where VALUE is either 'yes' or 'no' or'maybe'.assistant

Based on the study, the results suggest that mutations causing low HDL-C do not promote increased carotid intima-media thickness. The study found that despite significantly lower HDL cholesterol levels in cases compared to controls, the cIMT measurements were nearly identical between the two groups. This implies that low HDL-C due to genetic mutations may not necessarily lead to increased atherosclerosis, as indicated by cIMT.

You are supposed to summarize the key information from the given context to answer the provided question.

Here is the given context:
"We evaluated the usefulness of a short stay or 23-hour ward in a pediatric unit of a large teaching hospital, Westmead Hospital, and an academic Children's hospital, The New Children's Hospital, to determine if they are a useful addition to the emergency service. This is a descriptive comparison of prospectively collected data on all children admitted to the short stay ward at Westmead Hospital (WH) during 1994 and the short stay ward at the New Children's Hospital (NCH) during 1997-98. These hospitals service an identical demographic area with the latter (NCH) a tertiary referral center. The following outcome measures were used: length of stay, appropriateness of stay, rate of admission to an in-hospital bed, and rate of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge. Adverse events were reported and patient follow-up was attempted at 48 hours after discharge in all cases. The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% (Westmead Hospital) and 14.7% (New Children's Hospital) of admissions, with 56% medical in nature, 30% surgical, and the remainder procedural or psychological. Admission patterns were similar, with asthma, gastroenteritis, convulsion, pneumonia, and simple surgical conditions accounting for most short stay ward admissions. The short stay ward increased hospital efficiency with an average length of stay of 17.5 hours (Westmead Hospital) compared to 20.5 hours (New Children's Hospital). The users of the short stay ward were children of young age less than 2 years, with stay greater than 23 hours reported in only 1% of all admissions to the short stay ward. The rate of patient admission to an in-hospital bed was low, (4% [Westmead Hospital] compared to 6% [New Children's Hospital]), with the number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of short stay ward discharge less than 1%. There were no adverse events reported at either short stay ward, with parental satisfaction high. The short stay ward was developed through reallocation of resources from within the hospital to the short stay ward. This resulted in estimated savings of $1/2 million (Westmead Hospital) to $2.3 million (New Children's Hospital) to the hospital, due to more efficient bed usage."

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.
assistant
The study evaluated the effectiveness of short stay or 23-hour wards in two pediatric units: one at Westmead Hospital and another at The New Children's Hospital. Both hospitals serve an identical demographic area, with The New Children's Hospital being a tertiary referral center. Key findings include:

1. **Admissions**: 
   - The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% of admissions at Westmead Hospital and 14.7% at The New Children's Hospital.
   - Medical admissions made up 56%, surgical admissions 30%, and the rest were procedural or psychological.
   
2. **Patient Demographics**:
   - Most admissions were of children under 2 years old.
   - Only 1% of admissions lasted longer than 23 hours.

3. **Length of Stay**:
   - Average length of stay was 17.5 hours at Westmead Hospital and 20.5 hours at The New Children's Hospital.

4. **Utilization**:
   - The rate of patients needing an in-hospital bed was low, at 4% for Westmead Hospital and 6% for The New Children's Hospital.
   - Less than 1% of patients had unscheduled visits within 72 hours post-discharge.

5. **Safety and Satisfaction**:
   - No adverse events were reported.
   - Parental satisfaction was high.

6. **Cost Efficiency**:
   - The short stay ward led to more efficient bed usage.
   - Estimated savings ranged from $0.5 million to $2.3 million per year for each hospital.

Overall, the short stay wards were found to be effective in improving hospital efficiency and patient outcomes while maintaining high levels of safety and satisfaction."

"The objective of the current study is to determine to what extent the reduction of Chile's traffic fatalities and injuries during 2000-2012 was related to the police traffic enforcement increment registered after the introduction of its 2005 traffic law reform. A unique dataset with assembled information from public institutions and analyses based on ordinary least square and robust random effects models was carried out. Dependent variables were traffic fatality and severe injury rates per population and vehicle fleet. Independent variables were: (1) presence of new national traffic law; (2) police officers per population; (3) number of traffic tickets per police officer; and (4) interaction effect of number of traffic tickets per police officer with traffic law reform. Oil prices, alcohol consumption, proportion of male population 15-24 years old, unemployment, road infrastructure investment, years' effects and regions' effects represented control variables. Empirical estimates from instrumental variables suggest that the enactment of the traffic law reform in interaction with number of traffic tickets per police officer is significantly associated with a decrease of 8% in traffic fatalities and 7% in severe injuries.

You are supposed to summarize the key information from the given context to answer the provided question.

Here is the given context:
"Trauma patients who require therapeutic anticoagulation pose a difficult treatment problem. The purpose of this study was to determine: (1) the incidence of complications using therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients, and (2) if any patient factors are associated with these complications. An 18-month retrospective review was performed on trauma patients>or= 15 years old who received therapeutic anticoagulation using unfractionated heparin (UH) and/or fractionated heparin (FH). Forty different pre-treatment and treatment patient characteristics were recorded. Complications of anticoagulation were documented and defined as any unanticipated discontinuation of the anticoagulant for bleeding or other adverse events. One-hundred-fourteen trauma patients were initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation. The most common indication for anticoagulation was deep venous thrombosis (46%). Twenty-four patients (21%) had at least 1 anticoagulation complication. The most common complication was a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring blood transfusion (11 patients). Five patients died (4%), 3 of whom had significant hemorrhage attributed to anticoagulation. Bivariate followed by logistic regression analysis identified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 9.2, 95%CI = 1.5-54.7), UH use (OR = 3.8, 95%CI = 1.1-13.0), and lower initial platelet count (OR = 1.004, 95%CI = 1.000-1.008) as being associated with complications.

The study examines the safety of therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients, specifically focusing on the incidence of complications and identifying patient factors associated with these complications. Key findings include:

1. **Incidence of Complications**: Out of 114 trauma patients who received therapeutic anticoagulation, 24 (21%) experienced at least one complication. The most frequent complication was a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring blood transfusion (11 patients).

2. **Mortality**: Five patients (4%) died, with three deaths attributed to significant hemorrhage related to anticoagulation.

Based on the provided information, while SLT shows promising outcomes, the current data does not definitively eliminate the need for LRT due to the higher incidence of primary nonfunction in the SLT group and the presence of fatty degeneration in more grafts from the LRT group.

Based on the provided information, there is still a need for living-related liver transplantation in children, as both split-liver transplantation and living-related liver transplantation have their own advantages and disadvantages. While split-liver transplantation has abolished deaths on the waiting list, living-related liver transplantation has shown better outcomes in terms of graft function and survival in some aspects. Therefore, the decision to choose between the two procedures should be based on individual patient needs and circumstances.

- However, the SLT group has a longer mean cold ischemic time compared to the LRT group.
- The SLT group has higher serum values of alanine aminotransferase during the first postoperative week.
- The LRT group has more grafts with signs of fatty degeneration compared to the SLT group.

Considering these findings, the results suggest that both SLT and LRT are effective in terms of patient and graft survival, and liver function. However, the incidence of primary nonfunction is higher in the SLT group, and the LRT group has more grafts with signs of fatty degeneration."

Based on the provided information, it seems that both split-liver transplantation (SLT) and living-related liver transplantation (LRT) have their own advantages and disadvantages. However, the incidence of primary nonfunction is higher in the SLT group, and the LRT group has more grafts with signs of fatty degeneration. Considering the high patient and graft survival rates in both groups, it can be argued that there is still a need for living-related liver transplantation in children, especially when considering the unique advantages of LRT, such as potentially shorter cold ischemic time and possibly better postoperative outcomes in some cases.

Here is the given context:
"Elevated resting heart rate (RHR) is a neglected marker in cardiovascular risk factor studies of sub-Saharan African populations. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of elevated RHR and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to investigate any associations between RHR and these risk factors in a rural population in Ghana. Cross-sectional analysis. A total of 574 adults aged between 18-65 years were randomly sampled from a population register. Data collected included those on sociodemographic variables and anthropometric, blood pressure (BP), and RHR measurements. Within-person variability in RHR was calculated using data from repeat measurements taken 2 weeks apart. Of study participants, 36% were male. Prevalence of casual high BP was 19%. In the population, 10% were current cigarette smokers and habitual alcohol use was high at 56%. As measured by body mass index, 2% were obese and 14% had abdominal obesity. RHR was elevated (>90 bpm) in 19%. Overall, 79% of study participants were found to have at least one CVD risk factor. RHR was significantly associated with age, waist circumference, and BP. Individuals with an elevated RHR had a higher risk (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.15-3.26%, p = 0.013) of casual high BP compared with participants with normal RHR independently of several established CVD risk factors. The regression dilution ratio of RHR was 0.75 (95% CI 0.62-0.89)."

Socioeconomic status, race, and mental health status were hypothesized to be related to SHSe and household smoking bans. Data were collected as part of The Baby's Breath Project, a hospital-based SHSe intervention trial targeting parents with a high-risk infant in the NICU who reported a smoker in the household (N = 99). Measures of sociodemographics, smoking, home and car smoking bans, and depression were collected. Overall, 26% of all families with a high-risk infant in the NICU reported a household smoker.

Only two mechanical factors: teeth grinding (odds ratio (OR) 2.0, 95% CI 1.3-3.0) and facial trauma (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.3-2.9) were independently associated with chronic oro-facial pain after adjusting for psychological factors. However, these factors were also commonly associated with the reporting of other frequently unexplained syndromes: teeth grinding (odds ratio (OR) 1.8, 95% CI 1.5-2.2), facial trauma (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.7-2.6)."

The following variables were analysed: displacement of the fracture, soft tissue injury, delay and type of treatment, complications, observation of the Hawkins sign, and functional outcome. There were 7 type I Hawkins fractures, 11 type II, and 4 type III and 1 type IV. Four cases developed avascular necrosis (2 Hawkins type II and 2 type III).

The Hawkins sign was evaluated to determine its predictive value for avascular necrosis in fractures of the neck of the astragalus. In a retrospective study of 23 talar neck fractures over a 13-year period, the following observations were made:

- Out of 23 cases, 7 had a type I Hawkins sign, 11 had a type II, and 4 had types III and IV.
- Four cases developed avascular necrosis: 2 with type II Hawkins sign and 2 with type III.
- Twelve cases showed the Hawkins sign, but none of these developed necrosis.
- Four cases without a positive Hawkins sign did develop necrosis.
- No statistically significant differences were found regarding the development of avascular necrosis based on fracture displacement, soft tissue injury, or delay in treatment.
- However, there was a statistically significant difference in the development of avascular necrosis when comparing the presence of the Hawkins sign (P=.03).

The Hawkins sign appears to have some predictive value for avascular necrosis in fractures of the neck of the astragalus, as indicated by the statistically significant difference found in the development of necrosis when comparing the presence of the Hawkins sign (P=.03). However, the absence of the Hawkins sign does not necessarily mean that necrosis will occur, as seen in the four cases without a positive Hawkins sign that still developed necrosis.

"With the advancement of an aging society in the world, an increasing number of elderly patients have been hospitalized due to aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). There is no study that compares the elderly cases of aSAH who receive the definitive treatment with those who treated conservatively. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of the definitive surgery for the acute subarachnoid cases aged 80 or older. We reviewed 500 consecutive cases with acute aSAH with surgical indication for aneurysm repair. Inoperable cases such as dead-on-arrival and the cases with both pupils dilated were excluded. We compared the cases aged 80 or older that received clipping or coil embolization with the controls that the family selected conservative treatment. 69 cases were included in this study (ranged 80-98, male:female=9:60). 56 cases (81.2%) had an aneurysm in the anterior circulation. 23 cases received clipping, 20 cases coil embolization and 26 cases treated conservatively. The cases with aneurysm repair showed significantly better clinical outcome than the controls, while World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) grade on admission and premorbid modified Rankin Scale showed no difference between them."

Three northern California family planning clinics. All women with abnormal Pap smear results referred for initial colposcopy and a random sample of those referred for repeated Pap smear. Medical records were located and reviewed for 90 of 107 women referred for colposcopy and 153 of 225 women referred for repeated Pap smears. Routine clinic protocols for follow-up--telephone call, letter, or certified letter--were applied without regard to the type of abnormality seen on a Pap smear or recommended examination.

Therefore, we conducted this prospective study to compare the diagnostic ability of FDG-PET in patients with cervical cancer complicated by DM and those without DM.

You are supposed to summarize the key information from the given context to answer the provided question.

Here is the given context:
"Telephone counseling and tailored print communications have emerged as promising methods for promoting mammography screening. However, there has been little research testing, within the same randomized field trial, of the efficacy of these two methods compared to a high-quality usual care system for enhancing screening. This study addressed the question: Compared to usual care, is tailored telephone counseling more effective than tailored print materials for promoting mammography screening? Three-year randomized field trial. One thousand ninety-nine women aged 50 and older recruited from a health maintenance organization in North Carolina. Women were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: (1) usual care, (2) tailored print communications, and (3) tailored telephone counseling. Adherence to mammography screening based on self-reports obtained during 1995, 1996, and 1997. Compared to usual care alone, telephone counseling promoted a significantly higher proportion of women having mammograms on schedule (71% vs 61%) than did tailored print (67% vs 61%) but only after the first year of intervention (during 1996). Furthermore, compared to usual care, telephone counseling was more effective than tailored print materials at promoting being on schedule with screening during 1996 and 1997 among women who were off-schedule during the previous year."

Problem:
"Can tailored interventions increase mammography use among HMO women?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.
assistant
The study investigated whether tailored interventions could increase mammography use among women aged 50 and older from a health maintenance organization (HMO) in North Carolina. Specifically, it compared the effectiveness of tailored telephone counseling and tailored print communications against usual care. The key findings are:

You are supposed to summarize the key information from the given context to answer the provided question.

Here is the given context:
"Telephone counseling and tailored print communications have emerged as promising methods for promoting mammography screening. However, there has been little research testing, within the same randomized field trial, of the efficacy of these two methods compared to a high-quality usual care system for enhancing screening. This study addressed the question: Compared to usual care, is tailored telephone counseling more effective than tailored print materials for promoting mammography screening? Three-year randomized field trial. One thousand ninety-nine women aged 50 and older recruited from a health maintenance organization in North Carolina. Women were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: (1) usual care, (2) tailored print communications, and (3) tailored telephone counseling. Adherence to mammography screening based on self-reports obtained during 1995, 1996, and 1997. Compared to usual care alone, telephone counseling promoted a significantly higher proportion of women having mammograms on schedule (71% vs 61%) than did tailored print (67% vs 61%) but only after the first year of intervention (during 1996). Furthermore, compared to usual care, telephone counseling was more effective than tailored print materials at promoting being on schedule with screening during 1996 and 1997 among women who were off-schedule during the previous year."

Problem:
"Can tailored interventions increase mammography use among HMO women?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

To answer the question of whether double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) is efficacious and safe in a community setting, the relevant information from the context can be summarized as follows:

**Efficacy:**

- DBE was used to evaluate anemia/gastrointestinal bleed, small bowel IBD, and dilation of strictures in 66 patients.
- Endoscopic therapy (electrocautery, biopsy, and stricture dilation) was performed in 41 patients (61.4% of the total).
- Pathology findings from video-capsule endoscopy (VCE) were confirmed in 74.4% of the cases.

**Safety:**

- The procedure was performed on 88 patients over a period of 4 years, indicating a manageable workload in a community setting.
- The mean time per antegrade DBE was 107.4 minutes, and the mean time per retrograde DBE was 100.7 minutes, suggesting a feasible procedure time.
- The distance reached past the pylorus (318.4 cm) and past the ileocecal valve (168.9 cm) indicates the ability to effectively access the small bowel.

Overall, the data suggests that DBE is a viable option for evaluating and treating small bowel disorders in a community setting, with a good balance between efficacy and safety."

A unique dataset with assembled information from public institutions and analyses based on ordinary least square and robust random effects models was carried out. Dependent variables were traffic fatality and severe injury rates per population and vehicle fleet. Independent variables were: (1) presence of new national traffic law; (2) police officers per population; (3) number of traffic tickets per police officer; and (4) interaction effect of number of traffic tickets per police officer with traffic law reform. Oil prices, alcohol consumption, proportion of male population 15-24 years old, unemployment, road infrastructure investment, years' effects and regions' effects represented control variables. Empirical estimates from instrumental variables suggest that the enactment of the traffic law reform in interaction with number of traffic tickets per police officer is significantly associated with a decrease of 8% in traffic fatalities and 7% in severe injuries. Piecewise regression model results for the 2007-2012 period suggest that police traffic enforcement reduced traffic fatalities by 59% and severe injuries by 37%."

The study examines the safety of therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients, specifically focusing on the incidence of complications and identifying patient factors associated with these complications. Key findings include:

1. **Incidence of Complications**: Out of 114 trauma patients who received therapeutic anticoagulation, 24 (21%) experienced at least one complication. The most frequent complication was a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring blood transfusion (11 patients).

2. **Mortality**: Five patients (4%) died, with three deaths attributed to significant hemorrhage related to anticoagulation.

3. **Risk Factors Identified**:
   - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 9.2, 95% CI = 1.5-54.7)
   - Use of unfractionated heparin (OR = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.1-13.0)
   - Lower initial platelet count (OR = 1.004, 95% CI = 1.000-1.008)

4. **Differences Between Heparin Types**: Patients receiving unfractionated heparin (UH) versus fractionated heparin (FH) showed differences in characteristics such as laboratory values and anticoagulation indications.

Overall, while therapeutic anticoagulation can be necessary in trauma patients, it carries a risk of complications, particularly in those with certain comorbidities and when using unfractionated heparin."

To date, there is no evidence supporting that EUS fellowships enhance residents' ultrasound (US) educational experiences. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of EUS fellowships on emergency medicine (EM) residents' US education. We conducted a cross-sectional study at 9 academic medical centers. A questionnaire on US education and bedside US use was pilot tested and given to EM residents. The primary outcomes included the number of US examinations performed, scope of bedside US applications, barriers to residents' US education, and US use in the emergency department. The secondary outcomes were factors that would impact residents' US education. The outcomes were compared between residency programs with and without EUS fellowships. A total of 244 EM residents participated in this study. Thirty percent (95% confidence interval, 24%-35%) reported they had performed more than 150 scans. Residents in programs with EUS fellowships reported performing more scans than those in programs without fellowships (P = .04). Significant differences were noted in most applications of bedside US between residency programs with and without fellowships (P<.05).

Here is the given context:
"To assess and compare the value of split-liver transplantation (SLT) and living-related liver transplantation (LRT). The concept of SLT results from the development of reduced-size transplantation. A further development of SLT, the in situ split technique, is derived from LRT, which itself marks the optimized outcome in terms of postoperative graft function and survival. The combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, thus raising the question whether living donor liver transplantation is still necessary. Outcomes and postoperative liver function of 43 primary LRT patients were compared with those of 49 primary SLT patients (14 ex situ, 35 in situ) with known graft weight performed between April 1996 and December 2000. Survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. After a median follow-up of 35 months, actual patient survival rates were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group.

- **Prevalence of Elevated RHR**: 19% of participants had an elevated RHR (>90 bpm).
- **Other Risk Factors**: 
  - 19% had casual high blood pressure.
  - 10% were current cigarette smokers.
  - 56% habitually used alcohol.
  - 2% were obese.
  - 14% had abdominal obesity.
- **Association with RHR**:
  - RHR was significantly associated with age, waist circumference, and blood pressure.
  - Individuals with elevated RHR had a higher risk (odds ratio [OR] 1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-3.26, p = 0.013) of casual high blood pressure, independent of other established cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.
- **Within-Person Variability**: The regression dilution ratio of RHR was 0.75 (95% CI 0.62-0.89).

These results suggest that elevated RHR is a relevant marker for cardiovascular risk in this rural West African population."

"To investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions.STUDY DESIGN/ A total of 123 dysphonic individuals with benign vocal pathologies were recruited. They were given either genuine acupuncture (n = 40), sham acupuncture (n = 44), or no treatment (n = 39) for 6 weeks (two 30-minute sessions/wk). The genuine acupuncture group received needles puncturing nine voice-related acupoints for 30 minutes, two times a week for 6 weeks, whereas the sham acupuncture group received blunted needles stimulating the skin surface of the nine acupoints for the same frequency and duration. The no-treatment group did not receive any intervention but attended just the assessment sessions. One-hundred seventeen subjects completed the study (genuine acupuncture = 40; sham acupuncture = 43; and no treatment = 34), but only 84 of them had a complete set of vocal functions and quality of life measures (genuine acupuncture = 29; sham acupuncture = 33; and no-treatment = 22) and 42 of them with a complete set of endoscopic data (genuine acupuncture = 16; sham acupuncture = 15; and no treatment = 11).

Problem:
"Is Acupuncture Efficacious for Treating Phonotraumatic Vocal Pathologies?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.assistant

To address the problem of whether acupuncture is efficacious for treating phonotraumatic vocal pathologies, the relevant information from the context is as follows:

- The study involved 123 dysphonic individuals with benign vocal pathologies, who were divided into three groups: genuine acupuncture, sham acupuncture, and no treatment.
- The genuine acupuncture group received actual needles at nine voice-related acupoints, while the sham acupuncture group received blunted needles that only stimulated the skin surface.
- Both the genuine and sham acupuncture groups showed significant improvement in vocal function (measured by maximum fundamental frequency produced) and perceived quality of life compared to the no-treatment group.
- However, the genuine acupuncture group showed structural (morphological) improvements, with a significant reduction in the size of the vocal fold lesions.
- The study suggests that acupuncture, both genuine and sham, may be effective in treating phonotraumatic vocal pathologies, but the genuine acupuncture group showed additional benefits in terms of structural improvements."

Here is the given context:
"To investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions.STUDY DESIGN/ A total of 123 dysphonic individuals with benign vocal pathologies were recruited. They were given either genuine acupuncture (n = 40), sham acupuncture (n = 44), or no treatment (n = 39) for 6 weeks (two 30-minute sessions/wk). The genuine acupuncture group received needles puncturing nine voice-related acupoints for 30 minutes, two times a week for 6 weeks, whereas the sham acupuncture group received blunted needles stimulating the skin surface of the nine acupoints for the same frequency and duration. The no-treatment group did not receive any intervention but attended just the assessment sessions. One-hundred seventeen subjects completed the study (genuine acupuncture = 40; sham acupuncture = 43; and no treatment = 34), but only 84 of them had a complete set of vocal functions and quality of life measures (genuine acupuncture = 29; sham acupuncture = 33; and no-treatment = 22) and 42 of them with a complete set of endoscopic data (genuine acupuncture = 16; sham acupuncture = 15; and no treatment = 11). Significant improvement in vocal function, as indicated by the maximum fundamental frequency produced, and also perceived quality of life, were found in both the genuine and sham acupuncture groups, but not in the no-treatment group.

Here is the given context:
"Recent evaluations of IT innovations in primary care have highlighted variations between centres and practices in uptake and use. We evaluated whether structural characteristics of a general practice were associated with variations in use of a web-based clinical information system underpinning a Managed Clinical Network in diabetes, between the years 2001 and 2003. Using a computerised audit trail, we calculated the numbers of web-based operations that occurred in each practice, stratified by staff type and year, and adjusted for the numbers of registered diabetic patients. In regression analyses, we determined whether total use was associated with structural characteristics of the practice (total list size, training status, numbers of GPs (general practitioners), mean age of the GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population and whether staff had received advanced training in diabetes care). Initially there were a few practices which made very frequent use of the information system, with relatively high numbers of practices using the facility infrequently. However, overall use gradually became more evenly spread. This effect was particularly evident among nurse users. Frequent use by GPs was evident in only a small number of practices, with mean GP use decreasing over the three years. In linear regression analyses, none of the general practice variables were associated with online use, either overall or stratified by staff type, except for the numbers of diabetes-educated staff. This was consistently associated with increased use by nurses and GPs."

However, the degree of tumour uptake of (18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -glucose (FDG) uptake is sometimes influenced by diabetes mellitus (DM). Therefore, we conducted this prospective study to compare the diagnostic ability of FDG-PET in patients with cervical cancer complicated by DM and those without DM.
