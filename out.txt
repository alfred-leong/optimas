You are supposed to summarize the key information from the given context to answer the provided question.

Here is the given context:
"The objectives of this study were to investigate longitudinal predictors of fear of recurrence in survivors of head and neck cancer (HNC) using Leventhal's Common Sense Model (CSM) as a framework. The research questions were as follows: (a) to what extent do HNC patients report fear of cancer recurrence? (b) To what extent are fears of recurrence manifestations of illness-related anxiety? (c) Are fears of recurrence closely related to current symptoms, disease, and treatment-related factors, or psychological/socio-demographic factors? (d) What factors are predictive of long-term fears of recurrence? A prospective repeat measures design was employed whereby a sample of 82 newly diagnosed HNC patients (54 males, 28 females, mean age 60 years) completed measures of fears of recurrence, illness perceptions, coping, and anxiety and depression, prior to treatment and 6-8 months after treatment (fears of recurrence only). A third of HNC patients at diagnosis reported relatively high levels of fears of recurrence, with 12% still reporting similar levels of fear 6-8 months after treatment. Fears of recurrence were not related to any socio-demographic factor (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and educational attainment) or disease, treatment, or symptom-related factors. Path analyses demonstrated that fears of cancer recurrence after treatment were directly predicted by pre-treatment fears and optimism."

Problem:
"Can we predict which head and neck cancer survivors develop fears of recurrence?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.
assistant
Based on the provided context, the key information related to predicting which head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors develop fears of recurrence can be summarized as follows:

- The study used a prospective repeat measures design involving 82 newly diagnosed HNC patients, assessing them before treatment and 6-8 months post-treatment.
- Pre-treatment fears of recurrence were found to be a significant predictor of fears of recurrence after treatment.
- Optimism also played a role in predicting post-treatment fears of recurrence.
- Fears of recurrence were not significantly related to socio-demographic factors (such as age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and educational attainment) or disease, treatment, or symptom-related factors.

In summary, the study suggests that pre-treatment fears of recurrence and optimism are predictive factors for developing fears of recurrence in HNC survivors, while other factors such as demographic and clinical characteristics do not significantly influence these fears.

Here is the given context:
"The prevalence of retinal haemorrhages after convulsions is not well established. As these haemorrhages are considered characteristic of child abuse, we investigated their occurrence after convulsive episodes to see whether the finding of haemorrhage should prompt further investigation. Prospective study of 153 children (aged 2 months to 2 years), seen in the emergency department after a convulsive episode. After a thorough history and physical examination, a retinal examination was performed by an ophthalmologist. If findings were positive, further investigation was undertaken to rule out systemic disorder or child abuse. One child was found with unilateral retinal haemorrhages following an episode of a simple febrile convulsion. A thorough investigation uncovered no other reason for this finding."

Problem:
"Convulsions and retinal haemorrhage: should we look further?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.
assistant
The context discusses a study aimed at determining whether the presence of retinal haemorrhages after convulsive episodes should prompt further investigation. The study involved 153 children aged 2 months to 2 years who were seen in the emergency department following a convulsive episode. Each child underwent a thorough history and physical examination, followed by a retinal examination conducted by an ophthalmologist. If retinal haemorrhages were detected, additional investigations were carried out to rule out systemic disorders or child abuse.

The study found that one child had unilateral retinal haemorrhages following a simple febrile convulsion. However, a comprehensive investigation did not identify any other cause for this finding. Given this information, the context suggests that while retinal haemorrhages can occur after convulsive episodes, they do not necessarily indicate child abuse and may be associated with simple conditions like febrile convulsions. Therefore, the presence of retinal haemorrhages alone should not automatically prompt further investigation in all cases, but a case-by-case evaluation is recommended.

Here is the given context:
"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is tightly linked to increased cardiovascular disease. Surgery is an important method to treat OSA, but its effect on serum lipid levels in OSA patients is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the effect of upper airway surgery on lipid profiles. We performed a retrospective review of 113 adult patients with OSA who underwent surgery (nasal or uvulopalatopharyngoplasty [UPPP]) at a major, urban, academic hospital in Beijing from 2012 to 2013 who had preoperative and postoperative serum lipid profiles. Serum TC (4.86±0.74 to 4.69±0.71) and LP(a) (median 18.50 to 10.90) all decreased significantly post-operatively (P<0.01, 0.01, respectively), with no changes in serum HDL, LDL, or TG (P>0.05, all). For UPPP patients (n=51), serum TC, HDL and LP(a) improved (P=0.01, 0.01,<0.01, respectively). For nasal patients (n=62), only the serum LP(a) decreased (P<0.01). In patients with normal serum lipids at baseline, only serum LP(a) decreased (P<0.01). In contrast, in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia, the serum HDL, TG and LP(a) showed significant improvements (P=0.02, 0.03,<0.01, respectively). In patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia, the serum LP(a) decreased significantly (P=0.01), with a similar trend for serum TC (P=0.06). In patients with mixed hyperlipidemia, the serum TC and LDL also decreased (P=0.02, 0.03, respectively)."

Problem:
"Does airway surgery lower serum lipid levels in obstructive sleep apnea patients?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.
assistant
The study evaluated the effect of upper airway surgery on lipid profiles in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The key findings are:

- **Overall Patients (n=113):**
  - Total cholesterol (TC) and lipoprotein(a) (LP(a)) decreased significantly post-surgery (P<0.01 for both).
  - No significant changes were observed in serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or triglycerides (TG).

- **Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) Patients (n=51):**
  - TC, HDL, and LP(a) improved significantly (P=0.01, 0.01, <0.01, respectively).

- **Nasal Patients (n=62):**
  - Only LP(a) decreased significantly (P<0.01).

- **Baseline Normal Lipid Levels:**
  - Only LP(a) decreased significantly (P<0.01).

- **Isolated Hypertriglyceridemia:**
  - Serum HDL, TG, and LP(a) showed significant improvements (P=0.02, 0.03, <0.01, respectively).

- **Isolated Hypercholesterolemia:**
  - Serum LP(a) decreased significantly (P=0.01), with a similar trend for TC (P=0.06).

- **Mixed Hyperlipidemia:**
  - Serum TC and LDL also decreased significantly (P=0.02, 0.03, respectively).

In summary, upper airway surgery appears to lower serum lipid levels, particularly total cholesterol and lipoprotein(a), in patients with OSA, with varying degrees of improvement depending on the type of surgery and the initial lipid profile of the patient.

Here is the given context:
"Physical examination to detect abdominal injuries has been considered unreliable in alcohol-intoxicated trauma patients. Computed tomography (CT) plays the primary role in these abdominal evaluations. We reviewed medical records of all blunt trauma patients admitted to our trauma service from January 1, 1992, to March 31, 1998. Study patients had a blood alcohol level>or =80 mg/dL, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15, and unremarkable abdominal examination. Of 324 patients studied, 317 (98%) had CT scans negative for abdominal injury. Abdominal injuries were identified in 7 patients (2%), with only 2 (0.6%) requiring abdominal exploration. A significant association was found between major chest injury and abdominal injury."

Problem:
"Blunt trauma in intoxicated patients: is computed tomography of the abdomen always necessary?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.

The context suggests that computed tomography (CT) scans are often used to evaluate the abdomen in alcohol-intoxicated trauma patients who have suffered blunt trauma. In a study of 324 such patients, 98% (317 patients) had negative CT scans for abdominal injury. Only 2% (7 patients) had abdominal injuries detected, and of those, only 0.6% required abdominal surgery. The study also noted a significant association between major chest injuries and abdominal injuries in these patients. This information implies that while CT scans are useful, they may not always be necessary for every alcohol-intoxicated trauma patient with blunt trauma and an unremarkable physical examination, as the majority do not have abdominal injuries.

The context highlights that specialty pharmaceuticals, which were initially designed for rare conditions, are now being used to treat common chronic illnesses. While these medications offer significant benefits such as increased life expectancy, improved quality of life, enhanced workplace productivity, and reduced healthcare spending, they come at a high cost. Key points include:

1. **Cost Implications**: Specialty pharmaceuticals are expensive, leading payers to demand robust evidence of their value.
2. **Challenges in Valuation**: There is a lack of comprehensive pharmacoeconomic data, making it difficult to determine the true value of these medications.
3. **Complex Management Needs**: These drugs require specialized handling, administration, patient education, clinical support, and risk mitigation.
4. **Distribution and Data Collection**: Specialized distribution systems are needed to ensure appropriate patient selection and data collection.
5. **Aging Population and New Medicines**: With an increasing number of older adults relying on these treatments for common diseases, managing the associated costs is becoming more challenging.
6. **Pharmacoeconomic Models**: Utilizing sophisticated models can help control the cost impacts of these specialty drugs effectively.

In summary, while specialty pharmaceuticals offer substantial benefits, their high costs necessitate careful management and valuation through advanced pharmacoeconomic models to ensure they are worth the price.

"To investigate whether low-tone SD was a precursor of Meniere's disease and whether patients with low-tone SD suffered from endolymphatic hydrops. This was a retrospective case review in the university hospital. A total of 184 patients with low-tone SD were divided into two groups with single and recurrent episodes. The progress, follow-up audiograms, and ECochG results of the patients were reviewed and compared with those of patients with high-tone SD and Meniere's disease. In all, 83 of 177 patients with low-tone SD unaccompanied by vertigo had recurrent hearing loss; 15 of the 83 developed vertiginous attacks. The remaining 94 patients had a single episode. Three of the seven patients with low-tone SD accompanied by vertigo had recurrent hearing loss; two of the three were subsequently confirmed to have Meniere's disease. The other four had a single episode. No difference in rate of progress from SD to Meniere's disease was observed among the low-tone and the high-tone SD groups. The average -SP/AP of each group with a single episode is smaller than that of other groups with recurrent episodes and Meniere's disease."

The context provides information on the prognosis of low-tone sudden deafness (SD) and its relationship to Meniere's disease. Here are the key points relevant to the question:

1. **Recurrence of Hearing Loss**: Among 177 patients with low-tone SD who did not initially experience vertigo, 83 experienced recurrent hearing loss, with 15 of these developing vertiginous attacks. This suggests that some patients with low-tone SD may progress to symptoms similar to Meniere's disease.

2. **Vertigo-Associated Cases**: Of the seven patients with low-tone SD who experienced vertigo, three had recurrent hearing loss, and two of these were later diagnosed with Meniere's disease. The other four had a single episode of SD.

3. **Comparison with High-Tone SD and Meniere's Disease**: There was no significant difference in the progression rate from SD to Meniere's disease between low-tone and high-tone SD groups.

4. **Auditory Testing**: The average -SP/AP (a measure likely related to auditory function) for patients with a single episode of low-tone SD was smaller compared to those with recurrent episodes or confirmed Meniere's disease. This suggests that patients with a single episode might have a better prognosis.

In summary, while some patients with low-tone SD do progress to symptoms characteristic of Meniere's disease, this is not an inevitable outcome. The presence of vertigo seems to be a more critical factor in predicting progression to Meniere's disease.

The given context suggests that viral infections may play a role in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). A retrospective study involving 483 patients with BPPV and a control group of 461 healthy subjects found that, with the exception of influenza and parainfluenza, serological levels of various viral agents (including HSV1, HSV2, Herpes zoster, EBV, CMV, adenovirus) were higher in the BPPV group compared to the control group. Additionally, there was evidence of seasonal variation, with certain viruses showing elevated levels in specific months. For instance:

- Elevated levels of HSV1 and adenovirus were noted in March and May.
- Herpes zoster, adenovirus, and influenza showed elevated levels in April.
- HSV1 had elevated levels in June.
- HSV1 and CMV had elevated levels in September.
- By October, all studied viruses showed increased levels in the BPPV group compared to the control group.

These findings suggest a potential link between viral infections and the occurrence of BPPV, though further research would be needed to establish causality.

Two to four months after a radiologist's lecture on the potential effects of radiation exposure related to CT scans, urology and orthopedic residents were surveyed regarding the number and types of CT scans they ordered, the use of alternative imaging modalities, and whether they used the lecture information to educate patients. Twenty-one resident lecture attendants completed the survey. The number of CT scans ordered after the lecture stayed constant for 90% (19 of 21) and decreased for 10% (two of 21). The types of CT scans ordered changed after the lecture for 14% (three of 21). Thirty-three percent (seven of 21) reported increases in alternative imaging after the lecture, including 24% (five of 21) reporting increases in magnetic resonance imaging and 19% (four of 21) reporting increases in ultrasound. Patients directed questions about radiation exposure to 57% (12 of 21); 38% (eight of 21) used the lecture information to educate patients.

"To determine the necessity of pelvic computed tomography (CT) in patients of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We reviewed the records of 400 patients of RCC, who underwent treatment at our institution between January 1988 and February 2001. These patients were evaluated pre-operatively with ultrasonograms (USG) and contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. USG or CT scans of these cases were reviewed for presence of pathology in the pelvis, which were classified into 3 categories viz; benign and likely to be insignificant, benign and likely to be significant; and malignant. Of the 400 cases, 114 were stage I, 68 were stage II, 99 were stage III and 119 were stage IV. In all patients, tumour was identified in the kidney on preoperative CT scan. Fourteen patients (3.5%) had an abnormality on pelvic CT. Five (1.25%) had category 1, three (0.75%) had category 2 and six (1.5%) had category 3 abnormality on pelvic CT. However, all these abnormalities in pelvis were detected prior to CT by other investigations (USG or plain x-ray). Of the six cases with malignant findings, two had superficial bladder cancer, one had RCC in a pelvic kidney and three had bone metastases in the pelvis."

The context reviews the necessity of pelvic computed tomography (CT) in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) by analyzing the records of 400 patients treated between January 1988 and February 2001. Pre-operative evaluations included ultrasonograms (USG) and contrast-enhanced CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis. The study found that:

- Out of 400 patients, only 14 (3.5%) had an abnormality on their pelvic CT scan.
- These abnormalities were categorized as benign and likely insignificant (5 patients), benign and likely significant (3 patients), and malignant (6 patients).
- Importantly, all pelvic abnormalities identified by the CT scan were also detected by other methods such as USG or plain X-rays before the CT scan.

Of the six cases with malignant findings, two had superficial bladder cancer, one had RCC in a pelvic kidney, and three had bone metastases in the pelvis. 

This suggests that while pelvic CT scans can identify certain abnormalities, these findings are often already detected by other imaging techniques like USG, indicating that pelvic CT may not always be necessary for every patient with RCC.

Pre-operative evaluations included ultrasonograms (USG) and contrast-enhanced CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis. The study found that:

- Out of 400 patients, only 14 (3.5%) had an abnormality on their pelvic CT scan.
- These abnormalities were categorized as benign and likely insignificant (5 patients), benign and likely significant (3 patients), and malignant (6 patients).
- Importantly, all pelvic abnormalities identified by the CT scan were also detected by other methods such as USG or plain X-rays before the CT scan.

Of the six cases with malignant findings, two had superficial bladder cancer, one had RCC in a pelvic kidney, and three had bone metastases in the pelvis. 

This suggests that while pelvic CT scans can identify certain abnormalities, these findings are often already detected by other imaging techniques like USG, indicating that pelvic CT may not always be necessary for every patient with RCC."

Based on the information provided, pelvic CT scans are not always necessary for every patient with renal cell carcinoma since many abnormalities can be detected by other imaging techniques such as ultrasound. However, in some cases, pelvic CT might still provide additional valuable information.

"The objectives of this study were to investigate longitudinal predictors of fear of recurrence in survivors of head and neck cancer (HNC) using Leventhal's Common Sense Model (CSM) as a framework. The research questions were as follows: (a) to what extent do HNC patients report fear of cancer recurrence? (b) To what extent are fears of recurrence manifestations of illness-related anxiety? (c) Are fears of recurrence closely related to current symptoms, disease, and treatment-related factors, or psychological/socio-demographic factors? (d) What factors are predictive of long-term fears of recurrence? A prospective repeat measures design was employed whereby a sample of 82 newly diagnosed HNC patients (54 males, 28 females, mean age 60 years) completed measures of fears of recurrence, illness perceptions, coping, and anxiety and depression, prior to treatment and 6-8 months after treatment (fears of recurrence only). A third of HNC patients at diagnosis reported relatively high levels of fears of recurrence, with 12% still reporting similar levels of fear 6-8 months after treatment. Fears of recurrence were not related to any socio-demographic factor (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and educational attainment) or disease, treatment, or symptom-related factors. Path analyses demonstrated that fears of cancer recurrence after treatment were directly predicted by pre-treatment fears and optimism."

Based on the provided context, the study aimed to investigate factors predicting fears of recurrence in head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors. The key findings relevant to your question are:

1. **Pre-Treatment Predictors**: Path analyses showed that post-treatment fears of cancer recurrence were directly predicted by pre-treatment fears and optimism. This suggests that individuals who already have higher fears of recurrence before starting treatment are more likely to continue experiencing these fears afterward.

2. **Longitudinal Factors**: The study used a prospective repeat measures design, following 82 newly diagnosed HNC patients for 6-8 months post-treatment. It found that while a third of patients reported relatively high levels of fears of recurrence at diagnosis, only 12% still reported similar levels of fear post-treatment. This indicates that pre-existing fears are a significant predictor but that other factors may influence the persistence of these fears over time.

In summary, the study indicates that pre-treatment fears of recurrence and optimism can be used to predict which HNC survivors might develop ongoing fears of recurrence.

"The prevalence of retinal haemorrhages after convulsions is not well established. As these haemorrhages are considered characteristic of child abuse, we investigated their occurrence after convulsive episodes to see whether the finding of haemorrhage should prompt further investigation. Prospective study of 153 children (aged 2 months to 2 years), seen in the emergency department after a convulsive episode. After a thorough history and physical examination, a retinal examination was performed by an ophthalmologist. If findings were positive, further investigation was undertaken to rule out systemic disorder or child abuse. One child was found with unilateral retinal haemorrhages following an episode of a simple febrile convulsion. A thorough investigation uncovered no other reason for this finding."

The context discusses a study aimed at determining whether retinal haemorrhages observed after convulsive episodes in young children should prompt further investigation. The study involved 153 children aged 2 months to 2 years who presented to the emergency department after experiencing a convulsive episode. Each child underwent a thorough history and physical examination followed by a retinal examination conducted by an ophthalmologist. If retinal haemorrhages were detected, additional investigations were carried out to rule out systemic disorders or child abuse. 

The study found that one child had unilateral retinal haemorrhages following a simple febrile convulsion. However, comprehensive further investigation did not identify any other underlying cause for this finding. Given this information, the study suggests that while retinal haemorrhages may be concerning and often associated with child abuse, they do not always indicate abuse, especially in cases of simple febrile convulsions. Therefore, the presence of retinal haemorrhages alone may not always necessitate further extensive investigation unless other clinical factors suggest the need.

"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is tightly linked to increased cardiovascular disease. Surgery is an important method to treat OSA, but its effect on serum lipid levels in OSA patients is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the effect of upper airway surgery on lipid profiles. We performed a retrospective review of 113 adult patients with OSA who underwent surgery (nasal or uvulopalatopharyngoplasty [UPPP]) at a major, urban, academic hospital in Beijing from 2012 to 2013 who had preoperative and postoperative serum lipid profiles. Serum TC (4.86±0.74 to 4.69±0.71) and LP(a) (median 18.50 to 10.90) all decreased significantly post-operatively (P<0.01, 0.01, respectively), with no changes in serum HDL, LDL, or TG (P>0.05, all). For UPPP patients (n=51), serum TC, HDL and LP(a) improved (P=0.01, 0.01,<0.01, respectively). For nasal patients (n=62), only the serum LP(a) decreased (P<0.01). In patients with normal serum lipids at baseline, only serum LP(a) decreased (P<0.01). In contrast, in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia, the serum HDL, TG and LP(a) showed significant improvements (P=0.02, 0.03,<0.01, respectively). In patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia, the serum LP(a) decreased significantly (P=0.01), with a similar trend for serum TC (P=0.06). In patients with mixed hyperlipidemia, the serum TC and LDL also decreased (P=0.02, 0.03, respectively)."

"Does airway surgery lower serum lipid levels in obstructive sleep apnea patients?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.
assistant
The study evaluated the effect of upper airway surgery on lipid profiles in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The key findings related to serum lipid levels are as follows:

- Overall, there was a significant decrease in serum total cholesterol (TC) and lipoprotein(a) [LP(a)] post-operatively, with no significant changes in serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or triglycerides (TG).

- For patients who underwent uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), there were improvements in serum TC, HDL, and LP(a).

- For patients who underwent nasal surgery, only serum LP(a) decreased significantly.

- Among patients with normal serum lipids at baseline, only serum LP(a) decreased.

- In patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia, serum HDL, TG, and LP(a) showed significant improvements.

- In patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia, serum LP(a) decreased significantly, with a similar trend for serum TC.

- In patients with mixed hyperlipidemia, serum TC and LDL also decreased.

These results suggest that upper airway surgery can lead to reductions in certain serum lipid levels in OSA patients, particularly in those with specific types of hyperlipidemia.

"To investigate whether low-tone SD was a precursor of Meniere's disease and whether patients with low-tone SD suffered from endolymphatic hydrops. This was a retrospective case review in the university hospital. A total of 184 patients with low-tone SD were divided into two groups with single and recurrent episodes. The progress, follow-up audiograms, and ECochG results of the patients were reviewed and compared with those of patients with high-tone SD and Meniere's disease. In all, 83 of 177 patients with low-tone SD unaccompanied by vertigo had recurrent hearing loss; 15 of the 83 developed vertiginous attacks. The remaining 94 patients had a single episode. Three of the seven patients with low-tone SD accompanied by vertigo had recurrent hearing loss; two of the three were subsequently confirmed to have Meniere's disease. The other four had a single episode. No difference in rate of progress from SD to Meniere's disease was observed among the low-tone and the high-tone SD groups. The average -SP/AP of each group with a single episode is smaller than that of other groups with recurrent episodes and Meniere's disease."

The study investigated whether low-tone sudden deafness (SD) progresses inevitably to Meniere's disease. Key findings include:

- Out of 184 patients with low-tone SD, 83 had recurrent hearing loss without vertigo, and 15 of these later developed vertigo.
- Among 94 patients with a single episode of low-tone SD without vertigo, none progressed to Meniere's disease.
- Seven patients with low-tone SD accompanied by vertigo: three had recurrent hearing loss, and two were later diagnosed with Meniere's disease.
- Four patients with low-tone SD and vertigo had a single episode without further progression.
- There was no significant difference in the progression rate from SD to Meniere's disease between low-tone and high-tone SD groups.
- Patients with a single episode of low-tone SD had lower -SP/AP values compared to those with recurrent episodes or Meniere's disease.

These results suggest that low-tone SD does not inevitably progress to Meniere's disease, and prognosis varies based on the presence and recurrence of symptoms.

This study also explored whether referring physicians are interested in radiation education and was an initial effort to address their CT ordering behavior. Two to four months after a radiologist's lecture on the potential effects of radiation exposure related to CT scans, urology and orthopedic residents were surveyed regarding the number and types of CT scans they ordered, the use of alternative imaging modalities, and whether they used the lecture information to educate patients. Twenty-one resident lecture attendants completed the survey. The number of CT scans ordered after the lecture stayed constant for 90% (19 of 21) and decreased for 10% (two of 21). The types of CT scans ordered changed after the lecture for 14% (three of 21). Thirty-three percent (seven of 21) reported increases in alternative imaging after the lecture, including 24% (five of 21) reporting increases in magnetic resonance imaging and 19% (four of 21) reporting increases in ultrasound. Patients directed questions about radiation exposure to 57% (12 of 21); 38% (eight of 21) used the lecture information to educate patients.

The study aimed to determine if educating residents about the potential effects of radiation exposure from CT imaging would alter their ordering patterns. After a radiologist's lecture, surveys were conducted with 21 urology and orthopedic residents. The findings indicated that:

- For 90% of the residents (19 out of 21), the number of CT scans ordered remained constant.
- For 10% of the residents (2 out of 21), the number of CT scans ordered decreased.
- For 14% of the residents (3 out of 21), the types of CT scans ordered changed.
- Thirty-three percent (7 out of 21) reported increased use of alternative imaging methods, specifically 24% (5 out of 21) reported more magnetic resonance imaging and 19% (4 out of 21) reported more ultrasound.
- Fifty-seven percent (12 out of 21) of the residents had patients ask about radiation exposure.
- Thirty-eight percent (8 out of 21) used the lecture information to educate patients.
- Referring physicians expressed interest in radiation education and requested similar lectures from other physician groups.

These results suggest that while some changes in CT ordering practices occurred, others did not, indicating that education can influence some aspects of CT ordering but may not universally reduce the number of scans ordered.

We reviewed the records of 400 patients of RCC, who underwent treatment at our institution between January 1988 and February 2001. These patients were evaluated pre-operatively with ultrasonograms (USG) and contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. USG or CT scans of these cases were reviewed for presence of pathology in the pelvis, which were classified into 3 categories viz; benign and likely to be insignificant, benign and likely to be significant; and malignant. Of the 400 cases, 114 were stage I, 68 were stage II, 99 were stage III and 119 were stage IV. In all patients, tumour was identified in the kidney on preoperative CT scan. Fourteen patients (3.5%) had an abnormality on pelvic CT. Five (1.25%) had category 1, three (0.75%) had category 2 and six (1.5%) had category 3 abnormality on pelvic CT. However, all these abnormalities in pelvis were detected prior to CT by other investigations (USG or plain x-ray).

- Only 14 out of 400 patients (3.5%) had an abnormality on their pelvic CT scans.
- These abnormalities were categorized as benign and likely insignificant (5 patients), benign and likely significant (3 patients), and malignant (6 patients).
- Importantly, all pelvic abnormalities detected by CT were also identified by other methods such as USG or plain x-rays before the CT scan.

Of the six cases with malignant findings, two had superficial bladder cancer, one had RCC in a pelvic kidney, and three had bone metastases in the pelvis.

Overall, the data suggest that while pelvic CT scans can detect certain abnormalities, many of these can be identified by other imaging techniques like USG, indicating that pelvic CT may not always be necessary for every patient with RCC.

(c) Are fears of recurrence closely related to current symptoms, disease, and treatment-related factors, or psychological/socio-demographic factors? (d) What factors are predictive of long-term fears of recurrence? A prospective repeat measures design was employed whereby a sample of 82 newly diagnosed HNC patients (54 males, 28 females, mean age 60 years) completed measures of fears of recurrence, illness perceptions, coping, and anxiety and depression, prior to treatment and 6-8 months after treatment (fears of recurrence only). A third of HNC patients at diagnosis reported relatively high levels of fears of recurrence, with 12% still reporting similar levels of fear 6-8 months after treatment. Fears of recurrence were not related to any socio-demographic factor (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and educational attainment) or disease, treatment, or symptom-related factors.

- Other factors such as socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and educational attainment), disease, treatment, and symptom-related factors did not significantly predict long-term fears of recurrence.

Therefore, the study suggests that pre-treatment levels of fear of recurrence and optimism can help predict which HNC survivors might develop persistent fears of recurrence post-treatment.

Prospective study of 153 children (aged 2 months to 2 years), seen in the emergency department after a convulsive episode. After a thorough history and physical examination, a retinal examination was performed by an ophthalmologist.

The context discusses a study investigating the occurrence of retinal haemorrhages in children after convulsive episodes to determine if such findings should prompt further investigation. The study involved 153 children aged 2 months to 2 years who were seen in the emergency department after experiencing a convulsive episode. Each child underwent a thorough history, physical examination, and retinal examination by an ophthalmologist. If retinal haemorrhages were detected, further investigations were conducted to rule out systemic disorders or child abuse. 

The key finding was that one child, who had experienced a simple febrile convulsion, was found to have unilateral retinal haemorrhages. However, a comprehensive investigation did not reveal any other underlying causes for this finding. This suggests that while retinal haemorrhages can occur after convulsive episodes, they may not always indicate child abuse and could be associated with simple febrile convulsions. Therefore, the presence of retinal haemorrhages alone may not necessarily require further investigation in all cases, but each case should be evaluated individually to rule out other potential causes.

Serum TC (4.86±0.74 to 4.69±0.71) and LP(a) (median 18.50 to 10.90) all decreased significantly post-operatively (P<0.01, 0.01, respectively), with no changes in serum HDL, LDL, or TG (P>0.05, all). For UPPP patients (n=51), serum TC, HDL and LP(a) improved (P=0.01, 0.01,<0.01, respectively). For nasal patients (n=62), only the serum LP(a) decreased (P<0.01). In patients with normal serum lipids at baseline, only serum LP(a) decreased (P<0.01). In contrast, in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia, the serum HDL, TG and LP(a) showed significant improvements (P=0.02, 0.03,<0.01, respectively). In patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia, the serum LP(a) decreased significantly (P=0.01), with a similar trend for serum TC (P=0.06). In patients with mixed hyperlipidemia, the serum TC and LDL also decreased (P=0.02, 0.03, respectively)."

The study evaluated the effect of upper airway surgery on lipid profiles in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The key findings are as follows:

- A total of 113 adult patients with OSA who underwent either nasal surgery or uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) were included in the study.
- Preoperative and postoperative serum lipid profiles were assessed.
- Post-operative serum total cholesterol (TC) and lipoprotein(a) [LP(a)] levels decreased significantly (P<0.01 for both), while there was no significant change in serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or triglycerides (TG).
- For UPPP patients (n=51), serum TC, HDL, and LP(a) improved significantly (P=0.01, 0.01, <0.01, respectively).
- For nasal patients (n=62), only serum LP(a) decreased significantly (P<0.01).
- In patients with normal serum lipids at baseline, only serum LP(a) decreased significantly (P<0.01).
- In patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia, serum HDL, TG, and LP(a) showed significant improvements (P=0.02, 0.03, <0.01, respectively).
- In patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia, serum LP(a) decreased significantly (P=0.01), with a similar trend for serum TC (P=0.06).
- In patients with mixed hyperlipidemia, serum TC and LDL also decreased significantly (P=0.02, 0.03, respectively).

Overall, the study indicates that upper airway surgery can lead to reductions in serum total cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) levels in OSA patients, with varying degrees of improvement depending on the type of surgery and the initial lipid profile of the patient.

Here is the given context:
"Physical examination to detect abdominal injuries has been considered unreliable in alcohol-intoxicated trauma patients. Computed tomography (CT) plays the primary role in these abdominal evaluations. We reviewed medical records of all blunt trauma patients admitted to our trauma service from January 1, 1992, to March 31, 1998. Study patients had a blood alcohol level>or =80 mg/dL, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15, and unremarkable abdominal examination. Of 324 patients studied, 317 (98%) had CT scans negative for abdominal injury. Abdominal injuries were identified in 7 patients (2%), with only 2 (0.6%) requiring abdominal exploration. A significant association was found between major chest injury and abdominal injury."

Problem:
"Blunt trauma in intoxicated patients: is computed tomography of the abdomen always necessary?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.

The context suggests that computed tomography (CT) scans are crucial for evaluating blunt trauma patients who are alcohol-intoxicated. From a review of medical records of 324 such patients admitted to a trauma service between January 1, 1992, and March 31, 1998, it was found that 98% (317 out of 324) had negative CT scans for abdominal injuries. Only 2% (7 out of 324) had abdominal injuries detected, and among those, only 0.6% required abdominal exploration. Additionally, there was a significant association noted between major chest injuries and abdominal injuries in these patients. Therefore, based on this data, CT scans of the abdomen appear to be highly effective and reliable in detecting abdominal injuries in intoxicated trauma patients, making them generally necessary for thorough evaluation.

"A case of spinal subdural hematoma (SSDH) following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) because of a ruptured internal carotid aneurysm is described. Such a case has never been reported. A 52-year-old woman underwent a craniotomy for a ruptured internal carotid aneurysm. A computed tomography scan showed that SAH existed predominantly in the posterior fossa and subdural hematoma beneath the cerebellar tentorium. Intrathecal administration of urokinase, IV administration of fasudil hydrochloride, and continuous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evacuation via cisternal drainage were performed as prophylactic treatments for vasospasm. On the sixth postoperative day, the patient complained of severe lower back and buttock pain. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a subdural hematoma in the lumbosacral region. Although the mass effect was extensive, the patient showed no neurologic symptoms other than the sciatica. She was treated conservatively. The hematoma dissolved gradually and had diminished completely 15 weeks later. Her pain gradually subsided, and she was discharged 7 weeks later without any neurologic deficit."

The context describes a unique case of spinal subdural hematoma (SSDH) occurring as a complication following a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to a ruptured internal carotid aneurysm. This case is unprecedented. Key points include:

- A 52-year-old woman underwent a craniotomy for a ruptured internal carotid aneurysm.
- Initial imaging (computed tomography) revealed SAH predominantly in the posterior fossa and a subdural hematoma beneath the cerebellar tentorium.
- Prophylactic treatments included intrathecal urokinase, IV fasudil hydrochloride, and continuous cerebrospinal fluid evacuation via cisternal drainage to prevent vasospasm.
- On the sixth postoperative day, the patient experienced severe lower back and buttock pain, which led to the diagnosis of SSDH via magnetic resonance imaging.
- The SSDH was located in the lumbosacral region with significant mass effect but no associated neurologic symptoms beyond sciatica.
- Conservative treatment was administered, and the hematoma resolved completely within 15 weeks.
- The patient's pain subsided, and she was discharged 7 weeks after the initial diagnosis without any neurologic deficits.

This case highlights SSDH as a potential sequela of SAH from a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, though it is important to note this is a rare occurrence.

This was a retrospective case review in the university hospital. A total of 184 patients with low-tone SD were divided into two groups with single and recurrent episodes. The progress, follow-up audiograms, and ECochG results of the patients were reviewed and compared with those of patients with high-tone SD and Meniere's disease. In all, 83 of 177 patients with low-tone SD unaccompanied by vertigo had recurrent hearing loss; 15 of the 83 developed vertiginous attacks. The remaining 94 patients had a single episode. Three of the seven patients with low-tone SD accompanied by vertigo had recurrent hearing loss; two of the three were subsequently confirmed to have Meniere's disease. The other four had a single episode. No difference in rate of progress from SD to Meniere's disease was observed among the low-tone and the high-tone SD groups.

Additionally, there was evidence of seasonal variations in viral serology levels between the BPPV and control groups, with certain viruses showing elevated levels during specific months. For instance, HSV1 and adenovirus levels were higher in March and May, Herpes zoster, adenovirus, and influenza levels were elevated in April, HSV1 levels were higher in June, and HSV1 and CMV levels were increased in September. Notably, in October, all studied viruses showed elevated levels in the BPPV group compared to the control group. These findings suggest a potential link between viral infections and the occurrence of BPPV.

"The aim of this study was to determine if educating residents about the potential effects of radiation exposure from computed tomographic (CT) imaging alters ordering patterns. This study also explored whether referring physicians are interested in radiation education and was an initial effort to address their CT ordering behavior. Two to four months after a radiologist's lecture on the potential effects of radiation exposure related to CT scans, urology and orthopedic residents were surveyed regarding the number and types of CT scans they ordered, the use of alternative imaging modalities, and whether they used the lecture information to educate patients. Twenty-one resident lecture attendants completed the survey. The number of CT scans ordered after the lecture stayed constant for 90% (19 of 21) and decreased for 10% (two of 21). The types of CT scans ordered changed after the lecture for 14% (three of 21). Thirty-three percent (seven of 21) reported increases in alternative imaging after the lecture, including 24% (five of 21) reporting increases in magnetic resonance imaging and 19% (four of 21) reporting increases in ultrasound. Patients directed questions about radiation exposure to 57% (12 of 21); 38% (eight of 21) used the lecture information to educate patients. Referring physicians were interested in the topic, and afterward, other physician groups requested radiation education lectures."

Problem:
"Will CT ordering practices change if we educate residents about the potential effects of radiation exposure?"

Please summarize the relevant information from the context related to the question.

The study aimed to determine if educating residents about the potential effects of radiation exposure from CT imaging would alter their ordering patterns. After a radiologist's lecture, surveys were conducted with urology and orthopedic residents. Key findings include:

- For 90% of residents (19 out of 21), the number of CT scans ordered remained constant.
- For 10% of residents (2 out of 21), the number of CT scans ordered decreased.
- For 14% of residents (3 out of 21), the types of CT scans ordered changed.
- Thirty-three percent (7 out of 21) reported increased use of alternative imaging methods, such as magnetic resonance imaging (24%) and ultrasound (19%).
- Fifty-seven percent (12 out of 21) of residents had patients ask about radiation exposure, and 38% (8 out of 21) used the lecture information to educate patients.

Overall, the study suggests that while some changes in CT ordering practices occurred, others remained unchanged, indicating that educational efforts can influence certain aspects of CT ordering but may not significantly reduce the overall number of scans ordered.

Here is the given context:
"The aim of this study was to determine if educating residents about the potential effects of radiation exposure from computed tomographic (CT) imaging alters ordering patterns. This study also explored whether referring physicians are interested in radiation education and was an initial effort to address their CT ordering behavior. Two to four months after a radiologist's lecture on the potential effects of radiation exposure related to CT scans, urology and orthopedic residents were surveyed regarding the number and types of CT scans they ordered, the use of alternative imaging modalities, and whether they used the lecture information to educate patients. Twenty-one resident lecture attendants completed the survey. The number of CT scans ordered after the lecture stayed constant for 90% (19 of 21) and decreased for 10% (two of 21). The types of CT scans ordered changed after the lecture for 14% (three of 21). Thirty-three percent (seven of 21) reported increases in alternative imaging after the lecture, including 24% (five of 21) reporting increases in magnetic resonance imaging and 19% (four of 21) reporting increases in ultrasound.

Based on the study findings, it appears that educating residents about the potential effects of radiation exposure can lead to some changes in CT ordering practices, such as altering the types of scans ordered and increasing the use of alternative imaging methods. However, the overall number of CT scans ordered did not decrease significantly for most residents.

Here is the given context:
"To determine the necessity of pelvic computed tomography (CT) in patients of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We reviewed the records of 400 patients of RCC, who underwent treatment at our institution between January 1988 and February 2001. These patients were evaluated pre-operatively with ultrasonograms (USG) and contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. USG or CT scans of these cases were reviewed for presence of pathology in the pelvis, which were classified into 3 categories viz; benign and likely to be insignificant, benign and likely to be significant; and malignant. Of the 400 cases, 114 were stage I, 68 were stage II, 99 were stage III and 119 were stage IV. In all patients, tumour was identified in the kidney on preoperative CT scan. Fourteen patients (3.5%) had an abnormality on pelvic CT. Five (1.25%) had category 1, three (0.75%) had category 2 and six (1.5%) had category 3 abnormality on pelvic CT. However, all these abnormalities in pelvis were detected prior to CT by other investigations (USG or plain x-ray). Of the six cases with malignant findings, two had superficial bladder cancer, one had RCC in a pelvic kidney and three had bone metastases in the pelvis."

The context provides information on whether pelvic computed tomography (CT) is necessary in cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Here's a summary of the relevant details:

- A review of 400 patients with RCC treated at the institution between January 1988 and February 2001 was conducted.
- Pre-operative evaluations included ultrasonograms (USG) and contrast-enhanced CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis.
- Pelvic CT scans were reviewed for any abnormalities, which were categorized into three groups: benign and likely insignificant, benign and likely significant, and malignant.
- Out of 400 cases, only 14 (3.5%) had an abnormality on their pelvic CT scans.
- Further breakdown shows that 5 (1.25%) had category 1 abnormalities, 3 (0.75%) had category 2, and 6 (1.5%) had category 3 abnormalities.
- Importantly, all these pelvic abnormalities were detected prior to the CT scan through other investigations such as USG or plain x-rays.
- Among the six cases with malignant findings, two had superficial bladder cancer, one had RCC in a pelvic kidney, and three had bone metastases in the pelvis.

Based on this information, the study suggests that pelvic CT scans may not be necessary in all cases of RCC, as most pelvic abnormalities can be detected by other imaging methods like USG.

Based on the study, pelvic CT scans do not seem to add significant value in detecting pelvic abnormalities in patients with renal cell carcinoma, as most such abnormalities can be detected by other imaging methods like USG. Therefore, pelvic CT scans might not be necessary in all cases of RCC.
